<h1>SRCF Desktop Service</h1>

<p style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 0.5em; font-size: 110%; font-weight: bold">The SRCF Desktop service will be <a href="http://wiki.srcf.net/News/DesktopServiceClosure">closing down on 29th July 2017</a>.</p>

<!--
<p><img src="/images/desktop.png" align="right"/>The SRCF is now operating a remote Linux desktop service.  This allows anyone with a SRCF account (<a href="/signup/">sign up</a> if you don't have one yet!) to obtain a graphical Linux environment from any computer on the internet.</p>

<p>Your desktop session can follow you wherever you go (suspend it on one computer, resume it on another and your applications are still running as you left them).  It can be used from any computer running Windows, Mac OS X, Linux or Solaris.  It will work over almost any internet connection, slow or fast.</p>

<p>The service offers a modern, user-friendly desktop environment that should be easy for Windows users to get used to (we offer <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> and <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">XFCE</a>, the three most popular Linux desktops, along with various other window managers for those with more esoteric requirements).</p>

<h3>What our users are saying</h3>

<ul>
<li><i>"My life is now complete"</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

<p>This service can be accessed through your web browser; there is no need to manually install client software!</p>

<ul>
<li style="padding: 4pt; background: #cdf;"><b><a href="webdesktop">Connect to your SRCF GNOME Classic desktop</a></b> (log in using your SRCF username and password)</li>
<li style="padding: 4pt">Alternatively you may instead wish to <a href="webdesktop/unity">connect to your SRCF Unity desktop</a>, <a href="webdesktop/kde">connect to your SRCF KDE desktop</a> or <a href="webdesktop/xfce">connect to your SRCF XFCE desktop</a>.</li>
<li style="padding: 4pt; font-size: 80%; color: grey">Advanced users who want a different window manager can implement their own X session: create a script called <tt>.xsession</tt> and then <a href="webdesktop/xsession">connect to your SRCF advanced X desktop</a> &mdash; but if you don't know whether you want to do this, you don't.</li>
</ul>

<p>The web client requires your browser to support Java, and is optimised for an average home internet connection (ADSL).  If you would like more control over the connection, or the web client doesn't work for you, please use <a href="desktop-standalone">the standalone client</a>.</p>
