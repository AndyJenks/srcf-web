<h2>Miscellaneous committee business</h2>

<ul>
<li>We were contacted by someone interested in improving our publicity and setting up a <code>talks.cam</code> analogue for societies.</li>
<li>More recently, the committee received an email from a University of Birmingham student who was interested in setting up an equivalent there; we replied to offer some advice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elections</h2>

<p>Malcolm and Ross were appointed tellers.</p>

<h3>Chair</h3>

<ul>
<li>Souradip Mookerjee stands (proposed: Tejas, seconded: Malcolm)</li>
<li>Elected unanimously (11)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secretary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dexter Chua stands (proposed: Malcolm, seconded: Daniel)</li>
<li>Elected unanimously (11)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Treasurer</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lev Livnev stands (proposed: Malcolm, seconded: Daniel)</li>
<li>Elected unanimously (11)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Publicity Officer</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tejas Guruswamy stands (proposed: Malcolm, seconded: Charles)</li>
<li>Elected unanimously (11)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Co-option of Charles Board to the committee</h3>

<ul>
<li>It was proposed that Charles Board be co-opted onto the committee again.</li>
<li>Elected unanimously (11)</li>
<li>Last year we granted Charles the ability to choose his own title; at this year’s meeting meeting, he (retroactively) chose “Grand Inquisitor”.</li>
<li>The committee extended to Charles the same choice for the next year, with the stipulation that the title he chooses must be different. Similarly, he has until the end of his term in order to make his decision.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="amendment-1">Constitutional Amendment (i)</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="amendment-1">constitutional amendment</a> was proposed by the (outgoing) Chair, in response to the proctors asking that we amend the senior treasurer clauses to closer match their recommended constitution.</li>
<li>The change subtly changes the clause that exempts the senior treasurer from liability for (some variety of) debt. The changes may be seen <a href="amendment-1">here</a>.</li>
<li>The meaning of various liabilities was clarified.</li>
<li>The requirement of ⅔ votes “for” was met, and the amendment was passed (unanimous: 11).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="amendment-2">Constitutional Amendment (ii)</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>The (outgoing) Chair proposed a <a href="amendment-2">second amendment</a>. It was proposed because this clause differed somewhat from their recommended constitution. (This was not explicitly requested by the proctors.)</li>
<li>This change affects the clause that provides for a mechanism to dissolve the society, and what becomes of its assets should it be dissolved. The proposed changes may be seen <a href="amendment-2">here</a>.</li>
<li>Concern was raised that this clause makes it surprisingly easy to dissolve the society: it would require 6 members (to call an EGM; 4 to do the actual dissolution) and 14 days notice (7 for the EGM, 14 for dissolution).</li>
<li>We have a disproportionately large membership (9000); in contrast, typically ~11 turn up to meetings.</li>
<li>The existing constitution does not mention a mechanism for dissolving the society, though we felt it was covered by the provisions for calling an EGM (at which the society may be dissolved).</li>
<li>The voting was unanimous <em>against</em>, and the amendment was rejected.</li>
<li>The new committee were advised, if they wish, to consider proposing a slightly different amendment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Any other business</h2>

<ul>
<li>CUER’s Atlassian software
<ul>
<li>If unchecked, consumes an unreasonable amount of resources.</li>
<li>We have been nicing and pinning it to a single core.</li>
<li>It is reported that this noticeably degrades its performance.</li>
<li>We are looking at modifying its start-up scripts so that it starts niced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The post-AGM curry was a success.</li>
</ul>
