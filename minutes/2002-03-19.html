<h1>Minutes of SRCF committee meeting held Tuesday 19th March 2002</h1>
<h2>Here's a list of some of the things that were discussed that evening - more as a reminder to the people who were present than as an official record.</h2>


<p>
1. Make sure that Kern2 gets sorted out (ie faulty parts sent back to
supplier) sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
2. Using Zeus webserver on Kern - committee needs to make a decision on
this. It is a philosophical point (use of non-free software) rather than a
technical one.
</p>
<p>
3. 'srcf' manpage needs to be updated.
</p>
<p>
4. We should investigate a more formal bug trackign system, althoug it was
decided to continue using the mailing list for the time being.
</p>
<p>
5. People other than mk270 should learn about ttybuf (?) and other log
monitoring tools.
</p>
<p>
6. MySQL provisioning script for societies needs to be sorted out.
</p>
<p>
7. Procedure for updating MOTD needs to be documented.
</p>
<p>
8. Amanda or equivalent needs to be investigated, with the aim of
persuading some CUSU bod to rotate log tapes on our behalf.
</p>
<p>
9. We should write and maintain a FAQ for users.
</p>
<p>
10. cron.daily needs to be investigated apparently
</p>
<p>
11. pjc50 asked me to write down 'sanity-check' - I'm not sure exactly
what needs to be done with it (documentation?)
