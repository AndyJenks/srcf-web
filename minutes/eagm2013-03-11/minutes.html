<h2>Minutes of SRCF AGM of 11<sup>th</sup> March 2013</h2>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2013-03-11</p>

<p><strong>Minutes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This AGM was authorised by and at the EGM of the same date.</li>
<li>The <a href='reports.pdf'>Chairman's report</a> is delivered.</li>
<li>The <a href='reports.pdf'>Treasurer's report</a> is delivered.
<ol>
<li>No major problems this past year.</li>
<li>Accounts were submitted on time.</li>
<li>A small profit (~&pound;100) was accrued this AGM-year.</li>
<li>It is noted that academic years and AGM-years don't line up, making this above assertion difficult to determine from the accounts submitted alone.</li>
<li>Have received donations of just over &pound;500.</li>
<li>OpenMarket sponsored the garden party for &pound;200
<ol>
<li>This is twice that of last year.</li>
<li>Most of this was spent on pizza, Pimms.</li>
<li>Representatives from OpenMarket were once again present.</li></ol></li>
<li>A major expenditure was on a UPS for ~&pound;300.</li>
<li>Matthew Ireland was reimbursed for purchasing stash (&pound;170) as Publicity Officer.</li>
<li>The current treasurer proposes that the new treasurer may wish to shop around for bank accounts.
<ol>
<li>This is described as 'faff' by Daniel, Richard, Amar.</li>
<li>This was discussed at the last committee meeting and it was agreed that we would stand to make almost zero profit from this.</li></ol></li>
<li>Matthew Ireland questions a persistent &pound;25/yr cost in publicity until this year.
<ol>
<li>It is believed to be an outgoing cost, likely to do with the Freshers' Fair.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
<li>The <a href='reports.pdf'>sysadmins' report</a> is delivered.<br />In part delivered by the secretary, author of these minutes.<br />
<ol>
<li>Recruited 7 new sysadmins this year.</li>
<li>More than usual, perhaps because have become more streamlined in acceptance this year?</li>
<li>The UPS failed (its battery exploded).</li>
<li>The sysadmins helped out with a Computer Scientist's 'Part II' project - that of Nicholas Ngorok.
<ol>
<li>He was temporarily given use of 5 VMs.</li>
<li>This helped to test our strategy of helping people out with VMs.</li>
<li>Nothing appeared to go wrong.</li></ol></li>
<li>More sysadmins are still required.</li>
<li>Project for this year: virtualising everything that has yet to be virtualised!</li>
<li>A donation has been proposed by Third Light once again.</li></ol></li>
<li>A <a href='constitutional-changes/'>constitutional amendment</a> is proposed by resolution of the committee, suggested by the Chairman, Ben Millwood.<br />
<ol>
<li>It is proposed that all occurrences of the word 'Chairman' be replaced with 'Chair'.</li>
<li>These are noted to be those 'word's matching case sensitively and on word boundaries (that is the case-sensitive regex '\bChairman\b', so to speak).</li>
<li>The amendment is agreen upon by all present and will take effect as of the end of this AGM.</li></ol></li>
