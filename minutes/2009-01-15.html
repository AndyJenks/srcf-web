	<li><b>Action:</b> all present to investigate possible venues.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.retrosnub.co.uk/">Retrosnub Internet Services</a> collaboration:
	<ul>
	<li>Malcolm, in his triple capacities as SRCF sysadmin, SRCF secretary and Retrosnub Internet Services, has suggested a collaboration between the two organisations.</li>
	<li>The exact details are open to negotiation, but the broad outline is as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>Retrosnub offers services similar to those offered by the SRCF to ex-users of the SRCF, for a fee lower than that Retrosnub's standard pricing for such services</li>
		<li>Retrosnub donates a percentage of fees received from users back to the SRCF</li>
		<li>The SRCF advertises relevant Retrosnub services to SRCF users losing their accounts</li>
		<li>Retrosnub may also offer services complementing those offered by the SRCF to current SRCF users, such as domain registration and accounts for commercial ventures which may not use the CUDN</li>
		<li>Retrosnub will not offer services in competition with the SRCF; where a SRCF account would suffice, no Retrosnub account will be sold</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Malcolm did not participate in the ensuing discussion, due to a conflict of interest.</li>
	<li>A vote was held, and the committee agreed unanimously (3 for, Malcolm abstaining) to such a collaboration taking place.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>CGI handler license/copyright issues:
	<ul>
	<li>Interest has been expressed in the use of the SRCF CGI handler by other parties (e.g. JCN).</li>
	<li>The SRCF CGI handler was originally written by Seb Wills, with further contributions from Peter Clay, Matt Johnson, David and Malcolm.  However the code does not specify a license or copyright.</li>
	<li>Authors were emailed by Malcolm in November, suggesting that the code is licensed under GPLv2.  Seb replied saying that he was happy with this.  No other response was received.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Per-user/per-society subdomains:
	<ul>
	<li>As previously discussed, there are several advantages to moving users'/societies' websites onto individual subdomains.</li>
	<li>Discussion of suitable subdomain formats took place.  No final conclusion was reached; *.users.srcf.ucam.org / *.societies.srcf.ucam.org would be used for trial purposes.</li>
	<li>Sysadmins will continue investigating potential pitfalls and migration issues.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>New server:
	<ul>
	<li>Third Light have donated another server (thunder).  Malcolm took delivery of this from Michael Wells earlier this evening.</li>
	<li><b>Action:</b> Malcolm to install this.</li>
	<li>Discussion of possible uses of the server took place.  No final conclusion was reached.  The use will depend on its specification, which is not yet known exactly.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>CICCU donations:
	<ul>
	<li>CICCU have previously agreed to make a regular donation.  Another donation is currently due.</li>
	<li><b>Action:</b> treasurer to pursue this.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Database access from cyclone:
	<ul>
	<li>David has asked the sysadmins whether it is possible to have the MySQL daemon on pip listen on an interface accessible to cyclone, for development purposes.</li>
	<li>There are technical barriers to this &mdash; in particular, all user privileges currently only apply to access from localhost.</li>
	<li>Sysadmins may implement this in the long term but currently have more important things to do.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Complaints regarding access to #srcf:
	<ul>
	<li>There is currently no policy on who should have access to #srcf, and who can be kicked/banned.</li>
	<li>The channel is currently publically-accessible but bans happen on an ad-hoc basis and are implemented by anyone with operator privileges, usually without much discussion, the rationale being that a ban may be required to resolve an immediate problem and a discussion could take too long.</li>
	<li>One particular person (a SRCF user, banned for offensive comments) has complained about being banned and wishes to have the ban revoked.</li>
	<li>It was decided that the committee wished to have the power to overturn bans made by the sysadmins, which they would execute in this case to overturn this particular ban.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

</ol>
