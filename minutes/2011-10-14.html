  <h4>Advertising on the SRCF:</h4>

      SRCF.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Committee decided that links to sponsors are fine, provided that the
      sponsors will also appear on other society material.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h4>ToS Violation:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A user allowed another (non-university) person to use his email and
      account, violating terms of service, leading to a suspension of the
      user's account.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>ACTION: strongly reprimand the user, and then reinstate the
      account.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Sagemath:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>xh232 wants to install Sagemath on the SRCF, but it is &gt;2GB in
      size.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the committee does decide to grant permission, it will be on a
      trial basis.</p>
    </li>

    <li>

  <h4>CUSpaceFlight:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>CUSpaceFlight want 1TB of space on the SRCF, and have offered to pay

      own server.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>We would only do this if the sysadmins were willing. They might consider donating a sysadmin.</p>
