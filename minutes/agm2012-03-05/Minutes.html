<h2>Reports:</h2>

<h3>Chair's Report:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Events:
  <ul>
    <li>We held our Garden Party last Easter, in Trinity Hall: it was sponsored by OpenMarket.</li>
    <li>We had a stall at the fresher's fair.</li>
    <li>We held a Welcome Social in Trinity Hall in Michaelmas Term.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Membership: New membership is less than in previous years.</li>
  <li>Future: We will have to implement changes in the future, in order to maintain our relevance as people begin to use other service providers such as Google etc. However, we expect to continue to exist for some time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Financial Report:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Year started messily due to the mess left by the previous treasurer, however this has all been sorted by Ben and Daniel.</li>
  <li>We do not currently owe anyone money.</li>
  <li>We received £326 of donations.</li>
  <li>The donate button on our website was broken for some time, but is now fixed.</li>
  <li>Cyclone was sold for £120</li>
  <li>The Alphaserver was sold for £1</li>
  <li>OpenMarket sponsored our Garden Party, and have offered to do so again this year.</li>
  <li>Third Light donated two servers.</li>
  <li>We currently operate at a slight loss, but this is not immediately problematic.</li>
  <li>Some of our servers (Pip and VNCloud) have depreciated to £0, so we will need to plan in case they need replacement.</li>
  <li>The new treasurer will need to fix the fact that we currently have two seperate (and different) inventories.</li>
  <li>Ben thanks all donors.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Services are increasingly virtualized.</li>
  <li>We have migrated to srcf.net</li>
  <li>Fewer and fewer people want us, our largest service is hosting websites, however the sysadmins currently do not have the time to develop this further/</li>
