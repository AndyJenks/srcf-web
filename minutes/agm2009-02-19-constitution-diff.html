<h1>SRCF constitutional amendments made by the AGM of 19/02/2009</h1>

<em>Three amendments were made to the constitution, and are highlighted below.
All three amendments were additions of new points.</em>

<ol>
 <li>The name of the society shall be: The Student-Run Computing
 Facility.</li>
 <li>The Society's aims shall be: to provide UN*X/Linux/BSD services for
 undergraduates and other members of the society, including webspace, a
 central server, and training activities<strong><font color="#FF0000">, 
 and to do such other things as  conduce to the attainment of these 
 objects.</font></strong></li>
 <li>Membership of the society shall be extended to all members of the
 University and any others who may apply to the Committee.  Use of the
 facilities provided by the society shall be restricted to members and
 subject to an annual fee, which the Committee shall determine, and
 which may vary according to the type of use made of the facility.  The
 Committee may also set an annual membership fee of the society, and in
 addition may offer honorary memberships (free) and life membership (for
 a fee) to any persons as it sees fit.  It shall not refuse an
 application for membership on the grounds of race, sex, sexual
 orientation, religion, or political views.  It may, however, expel any
 member for behaviour likely to bring the society or university into
 disrepute, for acting in a way that is damaging to the integrity of any
 of the facility's machines, or for breaking any of the relevant rules
 relating to the use of computers in the University.  The administrators
 may suspend the account of anyone they suspect of the above, pending
 the decision of the Committee.  All members shall have full voting
 rights at society meetings.</li>
 <li>Meetings of the society:
  <ol>
   <li>The Annual General Meeting of the society shall be held each year
   in the Lent Term.  The time and venue of this meeting shall be
   publicised by the Committee at least fourteen days beforehand.
   PGP-Signed email shall be considered a valid way of making such
   official announcements to the society, and the chair's PGP key should
   be used in such matters.</li>
   <li>Ordinary Meetings shall be held as and when the Committee sees
   fit.  Such meetings may be social, training, or anything else the
   Committee feels is relevant to the aims of the society.</li>
   <strong><font color="#FF0000">
   <li>An Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of the society may be
   called by the Committee, or by at least six members. A notice calling
   for an EGM must: (1) include a clear statement of the purpose of the
   EGM, (2) state the date (which must be in Full Term), time (which
   must be reasonable), and venue (which must be in Cambridge) of the
   EGM, (3) be signed by those calling for the EGM, and (4) be presented
   to the Committee at least ten days before the EGM, but no more than
   fourteen days before. The Committee must circulate the notice
   verbatim to the society at least seven days before the EGM. An EGM
   may conduct any business necessary for the purpose it was
   called.</li>
   </font></strong>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>The Committee shall be elected at the AGM.  Nominations must be
 submitted to the Secretary at least three days before the AGM (in the
 absence of other nominations for any post, nominations shall be
 accepted at the AGM for that post), either on paper signed by proposer,
 seconder and nominee, or PGP signed by all three parties.  Any member
 of the society may be nominated for any Committee post (proposer and
 seconder are needed).  The Chairman of the AGM shall appoint two
 tellers at the AGM.  The Committee may co-opt additional Committee
 members as it sees fit, and shall be responsible for the appointment of
 system administrators, who shall be responsible to the Committee.</li>
 <li>The Committee shall consist of Chairman, Secretary, Junior
 Treasurer, and PR officer.  It shall meet at least once per term, and
 may invite any other persons to attend Committee meetings as it sees
 fit.  The Senior Treasurer shall always be invited to attend Committee
 meetings if (s)he wishes to.</li>
 <li>A Senior Treasurer shall be appointed by the Committee each year to
 audit the Society's accounts.  The Senior Treasurer shall not be liable
 for debt incurred by the society.</li>
 <li>Amendments to this constitution may be proposed by any six members
 of the society, or by resolution of the Committee.  Votes for the
 amendment of this constitution shall require the support of two thirds
 of those voting to effect the change, and may occur at AGMs
 <strong><font color="#FF0000">, or at an  EGM called explicitly for 
 that purpose.</font></strong></li>
 <li>In the event of the dissolution of the society, its assets shall be
 given to the University society with the most similar interests.</li>
</ol>
