<h2>Review of minutes of previous meeting</h2>

<p><a href="2014-05-11">Executive meeting of 11th May 2014</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Tejas resolved inconsistencies in various lists of sysadmins.</li>
<li>Alec’s <strong>actions</strong> for the logo &amp; stash are re-issued below.</li>
<li>The shared mailbox password was changed.</li>
<li><code>pip</code> was swapped out; it is now on new better faster stronger hardware.</li>
<li>No progress has been made on <code>srcf.ucam.org</code>. <strong>Action</strong> Sysadmins: wait a couple of weeks (so that we are past the busy freshers’ fair period) and then announce the deprecation again.</li>
<li>The Garden Party was a success; we are very grateful to <a href="http://www.openmarket.com/">OpenMarket</a> for their sponsorship.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exceptional Items</h2>

<p>User accounts policy</p>

<ul>
<li>We should be prepared to have to cancel graduated users if the UIS’ opinion changes.</li>
<li>We will receive a lot of @cam auto responses saying “my new email address is…”. 
<ul>
<li>The majority of those will not want to keep those accounts.</li>
<li>Automatically changing the email addresses on their accounts has DPA issues.</li>
<li>This would introduce a lot of work.</li>
<li>We should treat any bounce—including the auto-response—as “un-contactable” and therefore cancel them. This should be explicit in the ToS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We could warn people a few weeks before graduation with instructions on how to keep your account (i.e., changing the email address).</li>
<li>We should issue an email in September from a special email address that lets us collect bounces for automated cancelling.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Sysadmins: draft new terms of service. The sysadmins have the permission of the committee to proceed without review at another committee meeting.</li>
<li>We should warn people in advance of the new terms of service, before they go into effect, via email.</li>
</ul>

<p>Freshers’ fair &amp; Welcome Social</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to focus on recruiting Sysadmins, and should be seeking them at the fair.</li>
<li>Daniel has booked a room in Selwyn for ~£30; 7pm on Monday 20th October.</li>
<li>Tejas intends to print the date/time on business cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sysadmins</p>

<ul>
<li>The sysadmins email list oscillates between swamped and clear.</li>
<li>The newest sysadmins are Joshua Hunt (<code>jh861</code>), Souradip Mookerjee (<code>sm2030</code>), Michael Hsu (<code>mh701</code>).</li>
<li>The following have been met, but are not active sysadmins: Edward Lilley (<code>ejl44</code>), Joseph Joyce (<code>jj379</code>), Daniel Low (<code>twdl3</code>), Mark Chonofsky (<code>mc711</code>), Matthew Boyd (<code>mab211</code>), Gwilym Kuiper (<code>gjk32</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Tejas: Prune sysadmins: identify (guess) sysadmins that look inactive, and email them to ask whether they still want to be a sysadmin. Sysadmins that do not want to should have their accounts disabled for security reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Tejas: Send the prospective sysadmins a reminder in the hope that they will join / become active.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pyro’s disks</p>

<ul>
<li>(Pyro runs ash, our backup server)</li>
<li>One of its disks are now so slow that backups are taking too long.</li>
<li>It has 3x1.5TB disks.</li>
<li>Retrosnub will buy us a new disk for Pyro out of the referral-money-pot (and we remain grateful to Malcolm for this).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Any other business</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Daniel: <code>srcf-reactivateuser</code> currently does not check the danger flag; fix this.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Daniel: Doodle poll the sysadmins, immediately after the welcome social, to organise another hack day.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Sysadmins: Update the inventory page on the wiki. It should contain hardware inventory, and a brief overview of pools, and then instructions on how to view lists of VMs with XenCenter.</li>
<li>We currently have excess storage in the form of <code>alto</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions Summary</h2>

<p>Alec</p>

<ul>
<li>Investigate, possibly using PANDIS, acquiring a new logo and/or re-branding.</li>
<li>(having done the above) figure out what should be on the stash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Executive</p>

<ul>
<li>Consolidate passwords (internet banking, PayPal, etc.) and then (using something equivalent to symmetric encryption) store them in one location, to make it easier to hand over to new treasurers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sysadmins</p>

<ul>
<li>Wait a couple of weeks (so that we are past the busy freshers’ fair period) and then announce the deprecation again.</li>
