<p>The meeting was held on Friday 17<sup>th</sup> May 2015, between 2pm and 4pm, at St. Catharine's College, St. Chad's, Cambridge.</p>

<p>In Attendance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Souradip Mookerjee (Chair, Sysadmin, <code>sm2030</code>)</li>
  <li>Dexter Chua (Secretary, Sysadmin, <code>dec41</code>)</li>
  <li>Lev Livnev (Junior Treasurer, Sysadmin, <code>ll461</code>)</li>

  <li>Daniel Richman (Sysadmin, <code>djr61</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exceptional Items</h2>

<p>Signing of HSBC forms</p>

<ul>
  <li>We were not sure which of the current secretary (Dexter) or the secretary-during-AGM (Daniel) should be signing the forms.</li>
  <li>We photocopied the forms and both signed a copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alto disk failure</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alto had a disk failure in April. It costs about 60 pounds to replace</li>
  <li>Alto currently runs on RAID 10 with 6 disks, which means if we experience another disk failure, we have one-in-five chance that Alto will be broken (assuming each disk has equal likelihood of failing).</li>
  <li>Alto is used to run Cyclone in the Xen pool. However, the disk are only used to boot XenServer and hypothetically contain backups of other VMs, which are currently alive and functioning.</li>
  <li>The committee sees no need in purchasing a new disk.</li>
  <li>New disk will not be purchased unless we see a use for it.</li>
  <li>Worst-case scenario is that XenServer has to be reinstalled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Garden party</p>
<ul>
  <li>We should email the relevant parties as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>We have missed the deadline for booking Trinity Hall Fellow's Garden, but we might be able to get Trinity Hall Wychfield</li>
  <li>Proposed date and time is 12th June, 2015, 1300 to 1600</li>
  <li>We plan to order Pizza from Perfect Pizza</li>
  <li><strong>Action</strong> Souradip: Email OpenMarket for sponsorship.</li>
  <li><strong>Action</strong> Malcolm: Attempt to book Trinity Hall Wychfield</li>
</ul>

<p>Fresher's Fair</li>
<ul>
  <li>We will focus on recruiting sysadmins, as there is not much point in recruiting new members</li>
  <li><strong>Action</strong> Lev: Book a stall in Fresher's Fair.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Any other business</h2>

<ul>
