<ol>

	<ul>
	<li>The minutes of the previous AGM were ratified <i>nem.
	con.</i></li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Chair's report
	<ul>
	<li>The Chair delivered a report.</li>
	<li>Amongst the items reported, the Chair noted:
		<ul>
		<li>there were 147 signups to the SRCF last October, a
		new record;</li>
		<li>a new server (thunder) has been donated by Third
		Light;</li>
		<li>there has been an increase in the default quota
		allocated to users;</li>
		<li>stash has been acquired;</li>
		<li>there have been some social events;</li>
		<li>a recommendation to the next committee to arrange a

		<li>an intended LAN party fell through in Michaelmas
		owing to lack of sponsorship;</li>
		<li>there have been problems with HSBC and PayPal;</li>
		<li>his thanks to the sysadmins.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Junior Treasurer's report
	<ul>
	<li>The Junior Treasurer circulated a summary of the accounts
	(separate document), and delivered a report.</li>
	<li>Amongst the items reported, the Junior Treasurer noted:
		<ul>
		<li>there was a small profit, and a large turnover,
		during the year;</li>
		<li>expenditure on food and drink this year was greater
		than that on hardware;</li>
		<li>funds were being put into a savings account intended
		as a reserve for short-notice equipment replacement, as
		pip will soon be out of warranty.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>There was a question from the floor about the possibility of
	using (free) JANET SSL certificates; the reply was that these
	did not serve the required purposes, owing to the fact that the
	SRCF's hostname ends in <tt>.ucam.org</tt> rather than
	<tt>.cam.ac.uk</tt>.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Sysadmins' report
	<ul>
	<li>Malcolm Scott delivered a report on behalf of the
	sysadmins.</li>
	<li>Amongst the items reported, he noted:
		<ul>
		<li>the SRCF has nearly 5000 members, of which over 2000
		have shell accounts;</li>
		<li>a major achievement of the SRCF since the last AGM
		is the introduction of a desktop service, which has
		become popular;</li>
		<li>there has not been any major problem with day-to-day
		tasks in the last year;</li>
		<li>there have been some minor security incidents, but
		no major security incident in the last year;</li>
		<li>there has been one takedown notice in the past year,
		which was promptly resolved.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>A vote of thanks for Malcolm Scott
	<ul>
	<li>The Chair noted:
		<ul>
		<li>Malcolm resigned as secretary in January;</li>
		<li>the relevant details as to why he did so will be in
		the minutes;</li>
		<li>this proposed vote of thanks is a way of showing to
		Malcolm that there are no hard feelings over his
		resignation, and also to thank him for the many years
		that he has donated his time both as a sysadmin and as a
		committee member, and also to thank him in advance for
		the many future years that we hope he continues to be a
		sysadmin;</li>
		<li>he has been a sysadmin since June 2004, i.e.  for 4
		and a half years so far, and hopefully many more;</li>
		<li>he has also been a committee member 3 times;</li>
		<li>he donated us our first 'real' SSL certificate, and
		contributed to our first 'real' wildcard SSL
		certificate;</li>
		<li>he did most of the work to bring us back online
		after we got rooted in October 2007;</li>
		<li>he dealt with the only takedown request we received
		in the last year within 20 minutes, even though it
		arrived at 4:54 am.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This was passed <i>nem. con.</i></li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Constitutional amendments
	<ol>
	<li>The following motion was tabled:<br/>
	Add "4.3. An Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of the society
	may be called by the Committee, or by at least six members. A
	notice calling for an EGM must: (1) include a clear statement of
	the purpose of the EGM, (2) state the date (which must be in
	Full Term), time, and venue (which must be in Cambridge) of the
	EGM, (3) be signed by those calling for the EGM, and (4) be
	presented to the Committee at least ten days before the EGM, but
	no more than fourteen days before. The Committee must circulate
	the notice verbatim to the society at least seven days before
	the EGM. An EGM may conduct any business necessary for the
	purpose it was called."<br/>
	<br/>
	Replace " or meetings called for the purpose." with ", or at an
	EGM called explicitly for that purpose."<br/>
	<br/>
	There was some discussion over the possibility of unreasonably
	exploiting some of the above wording.  The motion was amended to
	add the words "(which must be reasonable)" after the word
	"time".<br/>
	<br/>
	The amended motion was proposed by at least six people.<br/>
	<br/>
	The amended motion was put to a vote by show of hands.<br/>
	17 voted for the motion.<br/>
	None voted against the motion.<br/>
	<br/>
	The amended motion was carried.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The following motion was tabled:<br/>
	Amend the section on elections to include the wording "All
	elections shall be held using Single Transferable Vote, with
	each ballot including an option to reopen nominations."<br/>
	<br/>
	There was a discussion of this motion.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Chair conducted a straw poll to determine support of the
	motion as given above and of possible amendments.  It being
	apparent that there was insufficient support for any single
	option to pass it as a constitutional amendment, the Chair did
	not put any motion to the meeting formally as a constitutional
	amendment.<br/>
	<br/>
	The meeting proceeded to consider how to conduct the elections
	for this meeting only.<br/>
	<br/>
	The question was put whether to include a "reopen nominations"
	("RON") option in each election.  A vote was held by show of
	hands.<br/>
	19 voted for.<br/>
	1 voted against.<br/>
	<br/>
	The question was therefore decided in the affirmative.<br/>
	<br/>
	Options for a voting system to decide the election in which
	there were more than two candidates were discussed.  The options
	mooted were first-past-the-post voting and (the University's
	flavour of) single transferable vote.<br/>
	<br/>
	A vote on these two alternatives was held by show of hands.<br/>
	8 voted for first-past-the-post.<br/>
	8 voted for single transferable vote.<br/>
	<br/>
	A further discussion ensued, in which a number of people
	indicated willingness to change their position in order to break
	the tie.<br/>
	<br/>
	A second vote on the two alternatives was held by show of
	hands.<br/>
	15 voted for first-past-the-post.<br/>
	2 voted for single transferable vote.<br/>
	<br/>
	It was therefore determined to hold the elections using a
	first-past-the-post system.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The Chair decided at this point, owing to time constraints,
	to move directly to the elections.</li>
	</ol>

		</ul>
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>There being some time remaining before the scheduled finish of the
meeting, the Chair returned to the item on Constitutional amendments.
	<ol>
	<li>The following motion was tabled:<br/>
	Append to the aims of the SRCF ", and to do other such things
	conducive to the attainment of these objects."<br/>
	<br/>
	The wording was amended to ", and to do such other things as
	conduce to the attainment of these objects." and proposed by at
	least six people.<br/>
	<br/>
	A comment from the floor was made opining that the additional
	activities currently being held were too inclined towards the
	IT-literate.<br/>
	<br/>
	The amended motion was put to a vote by show of hands.<br/>
	21 voted for the motion.<br/>
	None voted against the motion.<br/>
	<br/>
	The amended motion was carried.
	</li>
	<li>The remainder of the constitutional amendments was not put,
	owing to lack of time.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>Other business
	<ul>
	<li>A vote of thanks to the Committee and sysadmins was proposed
	and passed <i>nem. con.</i></li>
	</ul>
</li>

</ol>
