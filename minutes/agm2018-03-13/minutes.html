<h2>Chair&rsquo;s report (from Dexter)</h2>
<p>The SRCF has had a pretty successful year, with good turnouts to events. &nbsp;Freshers&rsquo; fair went well -- thanks to Will for organising. &nbsp;The freshers&rsquo; squash this year was targeted more towards sysadmin recruitment. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve had a couple of hack days over the last year, leading to the control panel release (more details in the sysadmins&rsquo; report).</p>

<h2>Treasurer&rsquo;s report (from Charles)</h2>
<p>Refer to the <a href="accounts">Accounts Summary</a>.</p>
<p>Accounts are from February 2017 to February 2018. &nbsp;The last year saw a large increase in balance due to two large donations. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re fairly well prepared in case of emergencies to buy and replace hardware. &nbsp;Thanks to Third Light for sponsoring the annual dinner, and to OpenMarket for sponsoring the garden party.</p>

<h2>Sysadmins&rsquo; report (from Richard)</h2>
<p>Refer to the <a href="sysadmins">Sysadmins&rsquo; Report</a>.</p>

        <em>Sysadmin since June last year, unsure how many months that is but spreadsheets can work that out. &nbsp;Adept with spreadsheets. &nbsp;Accounts are looking positive, would be a good idea to see what can be done with donations. &nbsp;Keen to look into new resources such as a new VM server.</em></li>

        <em>Enjoyed the societies fair, likes people in general, can also respond to emails in a timely fashion.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Question for the candidates: Are you both familiar with Paint and GIMP? <em>Yes!</em></p>
<p>Votes: 4 for David, 3 for Paul</p>
<p>David is elected Publicity Officer.</p>

<h2>Closing words (from Charles)</h2>
<p>Thanks all for coming, in particular those who ran for committee positions. &nbsp;Those that didn&rsquo;t make it in, we hope to still see you at other SRCF events. &nbsp;Enjoy the delights that the SRCF has to offer! &nbsp;Garden party will be up next in June, and there&rsquo;ll be plenty more committee elections next year.</p>

<h2>Any other business</h2>
<p>The post-AGM curry was once again postponed. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll get around to it eventually.</p>
