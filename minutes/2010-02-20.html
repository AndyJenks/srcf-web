<h2>Absence of Sysadmins from the meeting</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Malcolm couldn't
	come as he was involved (since those responsible tried to access his
	account) and Kristian is currently in Dubai, Ian is in Scotland,
	Ross is in Sweden. Others are busy.</p>
	<li><p>We need more
	Sysadmins.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The recent issue
		with spam being sent from the SRCF made this abundantly clear.</p>
		<li><p>Recent flamewars
		on #srcf have reduced its usefulness as a communication medium as
		some sysadmins and committee have ceased to read it as a result.</p>
		<li><p>[For this reason
		I (drt24) may apply /kick et al. in future.]</p>
	</ul>

<h2>Password Harvesting + ToS violation Incident
involving Oliver Stannard (os289), Matvey Soloviev (ms900) and
Frankie Robertson (fr272)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Daniel summarised
	what had happened based on discussions had and the recollection of
	the following information from sysadmins.</p>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li><p>(10th Feb, 11:39)
	os289 logs in from 128.232.159.143</p>
	<li><p>os289 su's to
	ms900</p>
	<li><p>ms900 runs a
	password search (terminating it early)</p>
	<li><p>...and finds,
	alas, an unimportant world-readable password in mas90's home
	directory (that password won't provide access to anything on the
	SRCF)</p>
	<li><p>(11:49) fr272 logs
	in from the same IP address, 128.232.159.143</p>
	<li><p>fr272 immediately
	re-reads the file containing the password then tries to su to mas90
	(Malcolm's unprivileged account) and then mas90-adm (Malcolm's
	privileged sysadmin account), presumably using that password --
	unsuccessfully of course.</p>
	<li><p>fr272 then runs
	another (simpler) password search in /home (terminating early again)</p>
	<li><p>...and then starts
	reading through various PHP files found by the search</p>
	<li><p>...and then
	successfully logs into MySQL several times using one society's
	account (CUPS, the Physics society - Their password has been reset
	and the account admins have been notified)</p>
	<li><p>fr272 then starts
	the search again in the background, redirecting to a file in his
	home directory</p>
	<li><p>fr272 then copies
	one other user's data into his home directory for good measure, and
	logs out</p>
	<li><p>fr272 logs back in
	from Girton (131.111.216.247) at 21:52 and 23:09 to check on the
	status of his backgrounded search</p>
	<li><p>Another user
	noticed the search running when looking at the output of 'top' this
	morning (2010-02-11), and notified the sysadmins</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li><p>Daniel has had
	discussions with both Frankie and Matvey.</p>
	<li><p>Oliver Stannard
	(os289) only provided access to the SRCF</p>
	<li><p>Matvey's actions
	were essentially equivalent to Ximin Luo's actions</p>
	<li><p>Frankie's actions
	were worse.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Fergus suggested
		that the same actions should be applied to both of them as were
		applied to Ximin.</p>
		<li><p>Daniel suggested
		that Frankie's actions were worse and so he should have his
		membership terminated and be allowed to reapply after two years.</p>
		<li><p>Malte suggested
		that it was better to apply the same actions to both as to Ximin as
		this is in-line with precedent and shows that we are being
		completely fair.</p>
		<li><p>Oliver Stannard
		did not appear to have been involved and the other two have
		admitted to all actions.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>He should have
			his account reinstated and be given a stern warning to be more
			careful who he allows to su from his account in future.</p>
			<li><p>Vote on this
			motion: <b>Motion passed unanimously</b></p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li><p>As per standard
	procedures, the matter was reported to CERT</p>
	<li><p>Matvey and Frankie
	will both have the same punishment applied: their membership will be
	terminated and they will be allowed to reapply for membership at the
	start of the next academic year (subject to the approval of the
	committee at the time).</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Vote on this
		motion: <b>Motion passed
		unanimously</b></p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Questions to be
	resolved:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Are failed su
		attempts emailed to sysadmins?</p>
		<li><p>Has Ian emailed
		CERT?</p>
		<li><p>What is CERT's
		response.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>World-readable /home - security risk?</h2>
<h3>Michael Darling's (md510) proposal to improve
user's security</h3>
<p>"To: committee@srcf</p>
<p>Subject: World-readable /home - security risk?</p>
<p>Hey,<br><br>I'd like
to put forward the issue of /home being world-readable by default. It
seems there's been at least two cases of people running password
searches on said open directories, and thus being banned as a result.
I'm not arguing in terms of rules, but evidently this kind of thing
does happen, so you can't just trust your users not to do anything
wrong.<br><br>The problem I can see is that there’s no foreseeable
reason to allow every user to see every other user’s files by
default. Many society admins hosting on the SRCF doubtless don’t
have enough technical expertise to know how to make stuff private,
and so they’re at risk just by signing up for an account and
uploading some files. I can’t imagine it being too difficult to
implement either – a default install of apache won’t mind /home
having 711 permissions (which is what I’m doing on my own personal
server, with multiple users and vhosts, so can attest to it working).
Failing that, having a 755 public_html and a 711 ~ would do, though
would take a little more effort to implement. At the moment it seems
just like a security risk, though I’m open to hearing why the
current setup helps.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Michael"</p>
<h3>Response from sysadmins:</h3>
<p>This particular
solution has not been discussed at length because it's achieves
nothing. <br>Making /home 0711 helps nothing; guess a CRSID and
you've got past the &quot;security&quot;.<br><br>Making each person's
~ 0711 (well, presumably 0771 for society accounts) is even worse.
You can still index within public_html, which is where the
world-readable passwords will be.<br><br>Basically, this is a
non-starter; Apache must be able to read public_html, so unless
Apache gets special rights (very hairy) everyone else must be able to
as well.”</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>This indicates
	there are good technical reasons why Michael's proposals do not work
	in practice.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p>Richard Whitehouse
	(rjw201) has indicated that he may submit a more complicated
	solution that might work. This involved having twice as many groups
	such that there are socname-apache and crsid-apache groups which
	have the apache user in them as well as the normal users. He will
	submit a proper proposal in due course.</p>
	<li><p>Fergus suggested
	it might be possible to do something using mod_suexec involving
	apache serving files as a different user and group</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p>We should ask
	sysadmins to investigate possible solutions</p>
</ul>
<h2>Cron job that looks for world readable files
containing passwords?</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Concerns about
	false positives</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>surely people
		will ignore them</p>
		<li><p>We would need a
		.password_ignore to deal with false positives (or people would be
		spammed every week).</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>We have had 4
	detected cases of people searching for passwords in the past two
	years.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>We should
		politely request that the sysadmins write a script to deal with
		this problem.</p>
		<li><p>Our next email to
		users should remind them to check that any files they have
		containing passwords are not world readable.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>If such a script
	is written we should not publicise the fact that we have done this</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>If we did we
		would have problems with false negatives as people might rely on it
		finding any world readable passwords that they might have.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Such as script
	would not be equivalent to what Ximin did as it would not quote the
	password in the file and would not cc sysadmins (or anyone else)
	only the society or user in question and it would  quote only the
	file name not the password.</p>
	<li><p>This solution
	doesn't need to be perfect but there should be something</p>
	<li><p>Ask the sysadmins
	to implement this basic script as a matter of semi-priority as a
	possible (imperfect) solution preferably before the AGM and to
	investigate a more complicated or complete system to replace it as
	time allows.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Motion Passed
		unanimously.</b></p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Appoint Nick Stenning (nhs27, borior) as a
sysadmin?</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Kristian has
	spoken to him and approves of his becoming a sysadmin however as yet
	none of the other sysadmins have.</p>
	<li><p>Approve of Nick
	Stenning becoming a sysadmin pending approval of a majority of the
	sysadmins (which should be sought as a matter of urgency).</p>
	<li><p><b>Motion passed
	unanimously.</b></p>
</ul>
<h2>AGM</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>AGM 18:00 on 9<sup>th</sup>
	March.</p>
	<li><p>We must ensure
	that there are no uncontested positions at the AGM</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p>We should
	encourage potential sysadmins to come to the AGM
	(committee/sysadmins can talk to them at the curry afterwards about
	becoming a sysadmin).</p>
	<li><p>Encourage
	potential committee people to come to the AGM and to stand for
	positions.</p>
	<li><p>We will announce
	the sale of old servers at the AGM as we have the blessing of Third
	Light to sell them (It should be noted that Third Light are
	awesome).</p>
	<li><p>We may announce
	upgraded desktop service at the AGM if the sysadmins have time to
	implement it by then.</p>
	<li><p>Should srcf.net be
	on the agenda of the AGM?</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Yes.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Curry</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Do we need to book
	anything? 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>No.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Work out where we
	are going? 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>No: Ask the AGM.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Malte noted that
	the place we went to last year was no particularly good or cheap.</p>
</ul>
