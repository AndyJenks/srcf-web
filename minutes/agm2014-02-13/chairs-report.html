<p>The first main event of the term of this committee was the annual garden party, held on the 13th of June. Last summer’s had promised to be a little different from previous years, in that we were approached by two other computer-related societies in Cambridge with the intent of hosting a joint technological societies’ garden party, not dissimilar from the one held by the science societies each year. However, this contrivance unfortunately fell through at the last minute, causing us to fall back to our backup plan and leading to a somewhat perfunctory event. Despite this and being plagued by deplorable weather, the garden party was well-attended, stoked with plenty of pizza and other food, was enjoyed by all, and can overall be considered a success. We thank OpenMarket for their attendance and generous sponsorship, allowing us to waive any admissions charge that would otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>After a relaxed summer, we exhibited as usual at the societies’ fair in October. In a slight alteration from previous years, many societies, including those related to technology, exhibited in a large tent on Parker’s Piece, instead of the usual location in the Kelsey Kerridge Sports Centre. This new venue was much kinder to those manning the stall, and so far as we could make out, did not have a significant impact on the number of people we spoke to. Indeed, we received 219 sign-ups to our mailing list at the fair and distributed over a thousand promotional cards. Our annual welcome social followed just over a week later: it was well attended by both new under- and post-graduates, and we received much interest from potential new sysadmins.</p>

<p>December saw the first celebration of our fifteenth anniversary, when we attended the dinner of the Cambridge University Computing Facility Society (sic). The dinner provided a great opportunity to catch up with SRCF members from the past, including two founding members. It was a great success, and thoroughly enjoyed by all 20 who came. We remain eternally grateful to ThirdLight for their kind and generous sponsorship, which allowed us to keep the ticket price accessible.</p>

<p>As of earlier this week, our total membership count was at 7822, of which just over 2500 are active users. We have 941 non-empty societies. Whilst to the casual eye, these figures may appear to reveal an increase of almost 500 members and 100 societies since the last AGM, the University Computing Service has not given us a list of expired users to purge, despite our repeated requests going back more than a year, so in reality it is hard to infer how many active users we actually have. Even so, the figures are somewhat more encouraging than those that we have seen in the past.</p>

<p>Over the course of the year, we have approved the appointment of eight new sysadmins: Matt Boyd, Mark Chonofsky, Joshua Hunt, Michael Hsu, Joseph Joyce, Edward Lilley, Daniel Low, and Souradip Mookerjee. This builds on the success of sysadmin recruiting during the term of the previous committee. I shall follow their development with much interest, as they integrate more fully into our sysadmin body and learn more about our systems.</p>

<p>Following the advice delivered by Mr Millwood at the 2013 AGM, we made a conscious effort to improve our offering of user support, on some occasions meeting with users to show them how to get started with our services. The sysadmins, particularly Mr Ryrie, have made excellent progress on providing more managed services for the less technically-literate. I’d like to think that this epitomises the friendly nature of the SRCF and will continue to develop over the years to come.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the fait accompli of this year—the irreversible accomplishment set in motion—was the move towards larger capacity and superior quality hard drives. 2 enterprise disks with a capacity of 4TB each were donated and installed in pip. We are most grateful for the donations by SRCF members Dominic Benson and Andrew Cooper for making this development, which is not improbably be the most significant advancement to the SRCF’s resources for over five years, possible. As a result of having had these two disks donated, the society is now in a position to purchase two more to complete our capacity and reliability upgrade of pip. We cannot necessarily consider the upgrade a panacea, since it does harbinger further issues concerning backup and failure recovery, but no doubt the sysadmins’ report will elucidate the accomplishment further.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to thank my fellow committee members for their exemplary endeavours over the last 12 months and making my job possible, the entire team of devoted sysadmins for their indefatigable efforts, and our users for co-operating in their operation of our shared resources and understanding of our volunteer nature.</p>

<p>I shall end with a quote from my favourite Roman scholar, scientist and author, Pliny the Elder, who wrote a phrase that translates splendidly as, “From the end spring new beginnings.” The end of the term of this committee springs the election of a new committee, which will take place shortly. As more and more students outsource their workloads to free on-line Web2.0 services, as well as facilities such as AWS that are becoming increasingly used across the world, it will be most interesting to observe how the SRCF evolves in terms of how our users utilise our facilities, and what new services we begin to offer over the years. In this way, there has never been a more exciting time to be on the committee or sysadmin team of the SRCF, and I look forward to more fifteenth anniversary celebrations over the coming year.</p>
