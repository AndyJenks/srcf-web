<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: SRCF Membership Lists</h2>

<h3 id="why">Why have I been subscribed to mailing lists called Soc-SRCF, Soc-SRCF-users, Soc-SRCF-maintenance and/or Soc-SRCF-social?</h3>

<p>The SRCF needs to be able to keep in contact with our users at all times (a requirement imposed upon us).  We therefore automatically subscribe you to Soc-SRCF, Soc-SRCF-users and Soc-SRCF-maintenance shortly after creating your account.  We will also subscribe you to Soc-SRCF-social if you requested this during the signup process.</p>

<p>These are very low-traffic mailing lists&mdash;just a few messages per year&mdash;and we do our best to ensure that the messages sent are relevant to as many people as possible.  We hope that you will not consider this to be an inconvenience.</p>

<h3 id="difference">What sort of message will be sent to these mailing lists?</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Soc-SRCF</b> contains <i>members</i> of the SRCF (membership is for life), and receives messages from the committee about such things as:
	<ul>
	<li>major society event announcements (e.g. AGMs, garden parties, etc.)&mdash;usually about three events per year</li>
	<li>rare but important society administrative information (e.g. constitutional amendments) which affect all members
	</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Soc-SRCF-users</b> contains <i>users</i> of the SRCF (which only applies whilst you have CUDN access, as per the Terms of Service), and receives messages from the sysadmins which are important to account holders, for example:
	<ul>
	<li>urgent messages which require the attention of every SRCF user (e.g. security compromises)&mdash;very infrequent, we hope!</li>
	<li>rare but important system administrative information (e.g. terms of service changes) which affect all users</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Soc-SRCF-maintenance</b> is used for announcements about planned and ongoing system unavailability (downtime), and announcements about important changes to service provision (e.g. increased quotas, software changes which may require your action, etc.).  If you are not interested in receiving such messages, you are welcome to unsubscribe, but many users find these announcements useful.</li>
<li><b>Soc-SRCF-social</b> is a more open mailing list for announcement and discussion of social events (pub meets, LAN parties, garden parties, UCS machine room tour, etc.).  Any SRCF member is welcome to join or leave this list at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unsubscribe">I would like to unsubscribe from Soc-SRCF and/or Soc-SRCF-users.</h3>

<p>Because we must be able to contact everyone with an SRCF account, you may only unsubscribe from <b>Soc-SRCF</b> or <b>Soc-SRCF-users</b> if you are willing to give up your membership of the SRCF and access to its services. If this is what you want, please e-mail the sysadmins &lt;<a href="mailto:soc-srcf-admin@lists.cam.ac.uk">soc-srcf-admin@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>&gt; saying you want to terminate your membership.

<p>Usually, when you leave the University and lose your access to our services, you will be automatically unsubscribed from Soc-SRCF-users&mdash;but <i>not</i> Soc-SRCF as you remain a SRCF member for life and are still welcome to attend SRCF events. As above, if you wish to give up this right you should contact the sysadmin team.</p>
