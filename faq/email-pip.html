<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Email on pip</h2>

<h3 id="reading">How do I read my SRCF email?</h3>

<p class="alert alert-warning"><b>This information applies only to users of the "legacy" or "advanced" SRCF
mail server.  It might apply to you if you had a SRCF account before October
2018</b> (or you deliberately chose to handle your mail this way).  To see
which email system you are currently using, see the
<a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p>There are four options:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Forward it to some other address. When your account is first set up
 it will be configured to forward mail to the address you gave us when
 you applied &mdash; see the FAQ entry: <a
 href="email#forwarding">How do I set up mail forwarding?</a> for
 instructions on how to configure this.</li>
 <li>Read your mail using an email client running on the server, for
 example <em>mutt</em> or <em>alpine</em>.</li>
 <li>Read your mail via IMAP from a remote machine.  You should always
 connect using a secure connection (enable &ldquo;SSL&rdquo; or the
 equivalent in your email client's configuration), otherwise your
 connection may be blocked. The incoming mail server name should be set
 to <tt>pip.srcf.net</tt> and the port should be set to 993. Note
 that we do not run a POP3 server, as it is an older protocol and
 provides no additional functionality over IMAP.
 <p><i>NB: If you wish to use IMAP, we especially
 recommend <a href="email-hades">Hades</a> due to
 <a href="#mbox-sucks">known quirks</a> of the IMAP server on pip.
 You can switch to Hades on the
 <a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.</i></p>
 </li>
 <li>Use our pip webmail service:
 <a href="https://webmail.pip.srcf.net/">webmail.pip.srcf.net</a>.
 <p><i><a href="email-hades">Hades</a> offers
 a significantly superior webmail experience for most users.  You
 can switch to Hades on the
 <a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.</i></p>
 </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="smtp">Can I use the SRCF machine as an outgoing (SMTP) mail
server?</h3>

<p>Yes &mdash; you can use <tt>smtp.srcf.net</tt>, port 587, using
STARTTLS.  Authenticate using your SRCF username and password.  This
service is part of <a href="email-hades#smtp">Hades</a> but is
available to all SRCF members whether or not your email is hosted
on Hades.</p>

<p>You cannot use <i>pip</i> as a SMTP server, though &mdash; except
from applications running on pip itself.</p>

<h3 id="forwarding">How do I set up mail forwarding?</h3>

<p class="alert alert-warning"><b>This information applies only to users of the "legacy" or "advanced" SRCF
mail server.  It might apply to you if you had a SRCF account before October
2018</b> (or you deliberately chose to handle your mail this way).  To see
which email system you are currently using, see the
<a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.<br><br>
If you simply want to forward your SRCF
email to an address elsewhere, we suggest configuring that using the
<a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.  If you
want a more complex mail forwarding setup, you could use a <b>.forward</b>
file, or <a href="email-hades#mailfilter">a Sieve filter on Hades</a>.</p>

<p>Create a file called .forward (note the leading full-stop) in your
home directory containing the email address to which you would like your
mail to be forwarded.</p>

<p>The SRCF offers a simple interactive tool to create this file for
you. Login to <tt>shell.srcf.net</tt> using <a
href="/utilities/ssh/">Secure Shell</a> and type:
<tt>srcf-MailForward</tt> at the prompt, followed by return. You will
then be prompted to enter an e-mail address where you would like all
your SRCF mail forwarded to. Once this program has run, type exit to
logout.</p>

<h3 id="mailfilter">How do I set up mail filtering?</h3>

<p class="alert alert-warning"><b>This information applies only to users of the "legacy" or "advanced" SRCF
mail server.  It might apply to you if you had a SRCF account before October
2018</b> (or you deliberately chose to handle your mail this way).  To see
which email system you are currently using, see the
<a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p>We have the <a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a> mail transfer
agent installed. See <a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/filter_ch01.html">the
Exim filtering documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you would prefer a simpler interface
to mail filtering, try <a href="email-hades#mailfilter">Hades</a>
which offers very powerful filtering using Sieve, with a friendly web-based
front-end.  (However, there are a few things which cannot be done on Hades,
such as piping your email into a custom program; for that purpose you
should use an Exim filter on pip.)</p>

<h3 id="mbox-sucks">You mentioned known quirks of mail on pip...?</h3>

<p>pip's mail service dates from a time long ago when most UNIX systems
stored email in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">Mbox</a>
format.  Mbox is a primitive file format which concatenates all emails
in a mailbox into one long file.  It is slow and inefficient to use,
and does not support concurrent access (you can't read your inbox whilst
a message is arriving, for example!).  Our IMAP server tries its best
by using caches and indices but it is fundamentally not an efficient
data storage system.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you create folders (besides INBOX) in which to file
your emails, those are placed in your home directory along with your
other files.  This leads to confusion, and also can lead to your entire
home directory being served over IMAP, which has been known to upset
email software (unsurprisingly).</p>

<p>And for added confusion, Mbox is incapable of storing any email
containg a line of text starting with the word "From".  Yes, really.
(Mail software has to rewrite it as "&gt;From" as a workaround.)</p>

<p>We cannot easily convert pip to a more modern email storage format,
though, as we have some people with extensively curated mbox hierarchies
and we don't want to break email for those people.</p>

<p>So (in September 2018) we created a brand new email service called
<a href="email-hades">Hades</a> which runs alongside the "legacy" email
service on pip.  Hades was implemented with the benefit of another 20+
years of advancements in email technology.</p>

<p>We encourage you to take a look at Hades.  If you're used to the
setup on pip, you may find it quite different (better, we hope!), but
if you have a complex Exim filter it may be time consuming to redefine
your email filtering requirements in Sieve on Hades.</p>

<p>We have no immediate plans to discontinue pip's mail service, although
eventually we hope to be able to shut down the IMAP server on pip as our
IMAP users migrate to Hades.  We know that there are some things that
advanced users might want to do which are only possible on a traditional
UNIX mail system, and we intend to keep running the mail service on pip
for these advanced use cases.</p>
