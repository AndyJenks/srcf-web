<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Databases</h2>

<h3 id="connect">How do I connect to my database?</h3>

<p>For security reasons our database server can only be accessed from
the machine on which it runs (pip). One result of this is that the
hostname to which a connection should be made must always be
<tt>localhost</tt> &mdash; <tt>pip.srcf.net</tt> and
<tt>www.srcf.net</tt> will not work. The username and password
should be those supplied when you applied for your database. If you
cannot remember the password, let us know and we'll reset it for
you.</p>

<h3 id="tunnel">Can I connect to my database from another computer?</h3>

<p>Yes, although for security reasons, this must be done using an
encrypted ssh tunnel. The command line to use is:</p>

<pre>mymachine$ ssh -L 9876:localhost:3306 shell.srcf.net
or:
pip$ ssh -R 9876:localhost:3306 mymachine</pre>

<p>For a PostgreSQL database replace 3306 with 5432.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="/utilities/ssh/">PuTTY</a> under MS
windows, then the setting you need is "Connection->SSH->Tunnels". Add a
new forwarded port, and specify source port 9876, destination localhost
and "Local" and then ssh to the SRCF server as normal.</p>

<p>Once the SSH tunnel is setup. connect to the mysql database using
<tt>127.0.0.1</tt>, port 9876. <b>NOTE</b> You must use
<tt>127.0.0.1</tt> and not <tt>localhost</tt> as otherwise mysql will
attempt to connect via the local UNIX socket and not TCP!</p>

<h3 id="phpmyadmin">Is there a web-based method of managing my
database?</h3>

<p>Yes, we have <a
href="https://www.srcf.net/phpmyadmin/">phpMyAdmin</a> installed:
<a
href="https://www.srcf.net/phpmyadmin/">https://www.srcf.net/phpmyadmin/</a></p>
