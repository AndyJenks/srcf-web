<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Programming</h2>

<h3 id="long-jobs">What should I do if I want to run a long job?</h3>

<p>Please be considerate of others when running long tasks. Make sure
that you use 'nice' to give them a low priority and double check your
code to make sure that there aren't memory leaks or other bugs which
might impair the performance of the system for the other users.</p>

<p>If you need to use a lot of computing time for academic reasons your
first port of call should be your department or college as they should
provide you with the resources you need for your studies. The SRCF is
primarily for personal and social use.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-help">Can you help me debug my PHP document/Perl
Script/C++ Program?</h3>

<p>Only if we have time - our sysadmins are all volunteers and we don't
consider this sort of thing to be what we are really here for. However,
we generally like hacking code, so if you're having problems drop us a
line and we might be able to help you out.</p>

<h3 id="java">Do you have Java&trade; installed?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>
