<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Email</h2>

<h3 id="reading">Options for SRCF mail processing</h3>

<p>Every member of the SRCF has a SRCF email address.  If your SRCF username is <tt>spqr2</tt>, your SRCF email address is <b>spqr2@srcf.net</b>.</p>

<p>(In fact you have as many email addresses as you want, by appending a suffix of your choosing: <b>spqr2-anything@srcf.net</b>.  You can use this for <a href="#mailfilter">filtering</a> different types of email in different ways.  You also have equivalent addresses in our old domain, <b>srcf.ucam.org</b>.)</p>

<p>You can choose (via the <a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>) one of three possible ways for delivering email sent to your SRCF email addresses:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Forward email</b> &mdash; all of your email is forwarded to another address.  For this we use the contact address you provided when you signed up, which you can also change on the <a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.</li>
	<li><b>The <a href="email-hades">SRCF Hades email service</a></b> &mdash; a modern email service.  If you want to read your email on the SRCF, rather than forwarding it to another email service, this is what we recommend.</li>
	<li><b>A .forward file, and/or a legacy mailbox on pip</b> &mdash; this is a primitive and somewhat unfriendly system for hosting a mailbox or forwarding mail, but does offer some programmability via the SRCF shell server; by writing an Exim filter file you can, for example, pass email messages to a custom program.  This is recommended only for advanced users and people who already have a mailbox on pip which predates Hades.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <b><a href="socmail">society email</a></b> is a bit different, and is always handled on pip.  We also offer <a href="other-services#lists">mailing lists</a>.</p>

<h3 id="smtp">Can I use the SRCF machine as an outgoing (SMTP) mail
server?</h3>

<p>Yes &mdash; you can use <tt>smtp.srcf.net</tt>, port 587, using
STARTTLS.  Authenticate using your SRCF username and password.  This
service is part of <a href="email-hades#smtp">Hades</a> but is
available to all SRCF members whether or not your email is hosted
on Hades.</p>

<h3 id="forwarding">How do I set up mail forwarding?</h3>

<p>The easiest way is to set your email mode to forwarding on the <a href="https://control.srcf.net/member">Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p>More-flexible forwarding is available, but the exact facilities depend on <a href="#reading">whether you are using Hades or pip</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="email-hades#forwarding">Forwarding on Hades</a></li>
	<li><a href="email-pip#forwarding">Forwarding on pip</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mailfilter">How do I set up mail filtering?</h3>

<p>Flexible mail filtering is available on both Hades (using Sieve) and pip (using an Exim filter).</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="email-hades#mailfilter">Mail filtering on Hades</a></li>
	<li><a href="email-pip#mailfilter">Mail filtering on pip</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="atlists">My mailing list, soc-something@lists.cam.ac.uk...</h3>

<p>Whoa!  Stop right there!  That's the <em>University Information Services</em> mailing list
system, not the <em>SRCF</em> one, and there's nothing we can do to help
you.  Try going to <a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/">lists.cam.ac.uk</a> instead.  If
it's an SRCF mailing list, it will end in @srcf.net or @srcf.ucam.org, and then we
can help you with it...</p>
