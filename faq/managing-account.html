<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Managing Your Account</h2>

<h3 id="password">How do I change my password?</h3>

<p>Log in to the SRCF server and issue the command <tt>yppasswd</tt>
&mdash; you will be prompted for your old password before being asked to
give the new one twice. Make sure that your choice of password is secure
&mdash; don't use dictionary words, names or anything else which can be
associated easily with you (such as a phone number or car registration
number), and please don't use simple substitutions (e.g. using
&ldquo;f15hcake&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;fishcake&rdquo;) as these can
be easily guessed. The best passwords are collections of random letters
and numbers, which you can remember by inventing a simple mnemonic. The
command <tt>apg</tt> can be used to suggest good passwords.</p>

<p>If you don't understand all of that, or have forgotten your old
password so you can't log in, you can email <a
href="mailto:sysadmins@srcf.net">sysadmins@srcf.net</a> and
we'll give you a new random password.</p>

<h3 id="friend">Can I tell my friend my password so that he can help
maintain my website?</h3>

<p>You are the only person authorised to use your password. If we find
any evidence that it is being used by someone else then your account
will be suspended indefinitely and without notice.</p>

<p>If you would like to run a website which is maintained by several
people then you should apply for a group account.</p>

<p>If you suspect that someone else knows your password, please change
your password immediately and notify <a
href="mailto:sysadmins@srcf.net">sysadmins@srcf.net</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ssh">What is SSH and why should I use it?</h3>

<p>SSH is a remote login protocol similar to telnet, but which uses
encryption to prevent eavesdropping. If you use telnet to log into any
machine, it is trivial for a cracker to obtain your password from any
machine on any of the networks between you and the remote machine - with
SSH this is not the case. We therefore require you to use SSH
to connect to our systems.

<h3 id="world-writable">What's your view on world writable files?</h3>

<p>World writable files are files that anybody on the system can write
to (edit).  Whilst in general you can trust other SRCF users not to
modify your files, there are several reasons why world-writable files
are a problem:</p>

<ul>
 <li>People make mistakes.  For instance, if you have a world-writable
 directory, and somebody runs &quot;rm -r /&quot; by mistake (this has
 happened at least once) then all the files in that directory will be
 deleted.</li>
 <li>Users' accounts may have been compromised.  We have had one
 incident where a worm entered the computer via an insecure society
 website and proceeded to overwrite every world-writable file on the
 computer.</li>
 <li>World writable files make things easier for attackers.  If for
 instance a directory underneath your public_html directory is
 world-writable then an attacker able to write files on the system could
 place a script there containing commands that he could execute as
 you.</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid problems like this we recommend that you avoid creating
world-writable files and directories, and if you have created them
then you change them to be non-world-writable.  You can do this using
the &quot;chmod&quot; command - &quot;chmod o-w filename&quot; will
remove world-writable permissions from a file and &quot;chmod -R o-w
~&quot; will do the same for all world-writable files in your home
directory.</p>

<p>Some cgi scripts will tell you that they need to have world-writable
files / directories to work.  This is almost certainly not the case on
the SRCF system where cgi / php scripts run as the user that owns them
rather than the webserver.  For society accounts it is often necessary
to make the files group-writable rather than world-writable (presuming
that the intended effect is to allow multiple members of the society to
write to them).  If you can't get a script to work without
world-writable files / directories then get in touch with <a
href="mailto:support@srcf.net">support@srcf.net</a> and we'll
see what we can do to help.</p>

<h3 id="world-readable">I can see everybody's files!</h3>

<p>This is the way it's supposed to be - on UNIX (and UNIX-like)
systems users can see all of each others' files by default (as UNIX
was designed for use in an academic environment to make sharing work
etc.  easier).  It is possible to remove the &quot;world
readable&quot; setting from files (log in on the command prompt and
run <tt>chmod o-rwx &lang;filename&rang;</tt>&quot;), and you should
do that with files containing passwords.  Similarly, you can create a
directory (perhaps called &ldquo;private&rdquo;) use the same command
to stop other users accessing it.  It's not a good idea to make your
whole home directory private as some programs (such as the web server)
need to see files inside it.</p>

<h3 id="security">Other security issues</h3>

<p>As well as keeping your password safe, you also need to make sure
that any additional software that you install is secure. Exploiting a
vulnerability that allows an attacker access either to your account or
that of a society user is often the first step in getting administrative
access to the machine. This is particularly true for PHP and CGI scripts
used on your website, but any software may be affected. Please take into
account the following when installing software of your own:</p>

<ul>
 <li>If there is a suitable piece of software in the stable Ubuntu
 release then ask us to install it centrally rather than installing your
 own copy. Centrally installed software gets upgraded automatically when
 security patches are released. You can search for Ubuntu packages at <a
 href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/">http://packages.ubuntu.com/</a>.</li>
 <li>Use existing software rather than writing your own, especially if
 there is an existing piece of software which is popular and has a
 strong community of users.</li>
 <li>Make sure you install security patches <em>as soon as they are
 released</em>. Google makes it very easy for attackers to find their
 targets once a vulnerability is known.</li>
 <li>Subscribe to the announcement mailing list associated with the
 software you install, so that you find out quickly about any security
 issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do suspect that an attacker has obtained access to your
account, please let us know immediately so that we can make sure that
they haven't made changes to the system.  Remember, if an attacker
successfully gains access, it may result in several days of downtime not
just for your website, but for everyone who uses the machine.</p>

<h3 id="graduation">What happens to my account when I graduate?</h3>

<p>You continue to be a member of the SRCF for life. As long as you are contactable
by email, your account will remain active. Note this means you will likely have to change
your address from <tt>@cam.ac.uk</tt> to something else when you graduate.
Contact the sysadmins at <a href="mailto:sysadmins@srcf.net">sysadmins@srcf.net</a> to do so.</p>

<h3 id="path">What is the full path to my filespace?</h3>

<p>Personal filespaces are kept in the <tt>/home/</tt> directory, for
example <tt>/home/abc45/</tt>. Society filespaces are in
<tt>/societies/</tt>, for example <tt>/societies/foosoc/</tt>. Although we 
try to minimise the number of changes to the filesystem, we
cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. We therefore
recommend that you avoid using absolute paths wherever possible, such as
by using relative paths instead. If this is not possible, we recommend
that you make it easy for you to change the location of your files, e.g.
by setting things up so that file locations can be specified in
configuration files.</p>

<h3 id="quota">How do I find out how much of my quota I have used?</h3>

<p>Simply log in and use the command:</p>

<pre>quota -gsQ</pre>

<p>Note that the <tt>-g</tt> is required as our disk usage quotas are
managed on a per-group rather than per-user basis, with each user having
their own group.</p>

<h3 id="morequota">I've run out of quota &mdash; Can I get it
increased?</h3>

<p>Our initial quota of <!--#include virtual="../default-quota.html" --> is deliberately set relatively low to
reduce the risk of users accidentally filling the disk (this is
surprisingly easy to do, for example with log files). If you would like
more and have good reason then just ask the <a
href="mailto:sysadmins@srcf.net">sysadmins</a> and we'll increase
it for you. Note that while disk space is cheap, we need to supply it
four times over (as we use RAID). More disk
space also tends to mean more bandwidth, and other problems associated
with running a larger server, so please be considerate in your disk
usage. If you need a lot more resources we may ask you
to consider making a <a href="https://www.srcf.net/donate">donation</a> towards the costs of running the
server.</p>
