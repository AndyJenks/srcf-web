<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: About the SRCF</h2>

<h3 id="what">What is the SRCF?</h3>

<p>The SRCF is the University of Cambridge's Student-Run Computing
Facility. We provide web hosting, shell accounts and various other
computing services to members of the University and groups such as
University societies. We are a University society, registered with
the Societies Syndicate. As such we are not formally supported by the 
University Administration in any way; instead the service is maintained 
by a group of volunteers.</p>

<h3 id="who">Who are the SRCF?</h3>

<p>The SRCF executive &mdash; the <a href="/committee">committee</a> and sysadmin (system administration) team &mdash; consists of current and former University of Cambridge students.
We hold elections for the committee positions every year at our AGM, according to our <a href="constitution">constitution</a>.
Any member of the University (staff or student) can <a href="/signup">register</a> to become a lifetime member of the SRCF, and so use our services.
We do not charge any membership fees, or require anything from our members beyond that they abide by our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why does the SRCF exist?</h3>

<p>The SRCF was formed in 1999 to provide services which the University Administration could not, including web hosting, mailing lists, and other computing resources for student societies.
Nowadays, the <a href="http://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/email-telephony-and-collaboration/map-collaborative-services/society-web-pages/computing">UIS</a> and many external hosting providers also offer similar services, but none provide as many features at no cost as the SRCF.</p>

<p>Our sysadmins volunteer due to their interest in the GNU/Linux operating system and related software, current server technologies, and to gain valuable experience administering large, multi-user, networked systems.
The SRCF also effectively functions as the Linux Users Group (LUG) of the University.</p>

<h3 id="system">What sort of systems do you run?</h3>

<p>We maintain and manage all of our own hardware (physically located in Cambridge) and software.
We primarily use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>
as it is free (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">in all
senses</a>), stable and relatively easy to maintain.</p>

<p>The SRCF's primary server, <tt>pip</tt>, is our shell server, and hosts our users' home directories and email.  It
has two six-core 2.1GHz Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPUs with 64GB of RAM and four 4TB
SATA disks.  This is currently running Ubuntu <!--#echo var="ubuntuversion" -->
(we normally upgrade once every year or two, in the summer).</p>

<p>Most of our other services run on our virtualised cloud known as
<tt>thunder</tt>.  This comprises a half-dozen assorted physical servers running the free version of XenServer
and a back-end storage server, <tt>alto</tt>. Several of these machines were graciously donated 
by <a href="https://www.thirdlight.com">Third Light Ltd.</a> and Peterhouse.</p>

<p>Virtual machines in public service include:</p>
<ul>
<!-- <li><tt>cyclone</tt>: <a href="/desktop">SRCF Desktop</a></li> -->
<li><tt>sinkhole</tt>: web (Apache) and PostgreSQL server
<li><tt>squirrel</tt>: MySQL database server</li>
<li><tt>cavein</tt>: long-running resource-hungry services, e.g. game servers</li>
<li><tt>blizzard</tt>: authoritative DNS (and DNSSEC) server</li>
<li><tt>flame</tt>: <a href="/faq/news">Usenet (NNTP) server</a></li>
<li><tt>flood</tt>: <a href="/faq/irc">IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Until 2006 we had just one server in use, <tt>kern</tt> (a dual Athlon
1.6GHz PC with 2GB of RAM and 400GB of disk).  Before that we
<em>used</em> to run on an ancient Intel Pentium running at 166MHz with
128MB of RAM.  How times have changed :)</p>

<h3 id="help">You guys are doing a great job.  How can I help you
out?</h3>

<p>We always welcome donations &mdash; as we don't charge for our services,
it's the only way we can afford to buy new hardware to keep up with the
demand. If you want to make a donation, please visit <a
href="https://www.srcf.net/donate">this page</a> and it'll tell you
what to do.</p>

<p>If you want to donate some time and experience to help us out, then
why not join our support team? This is an email-based help list for
problems not requiring administrative access to the SRCF server. If you
have experience of using a website or other services on the SRCF, and
want to help out, then send an email to <a
href="mailto:sysadmins@srcf.net">sysadmins@srcf.net</a> to be
added to the list. Many thanks in advance to all who volunteer!</p>

<p>We are also always recruiting new sysadmins. If you have experience administering Linux systems,
or are willing to learn, please send an email to the committee at <a
href="mailto:committee@srcf.net">committee@srcf.net</a>.
We will invite you to meet the sysadmin team in person, and discuss where you can help out.</p>
