<h3 id="sshkeys">Why can't I log in with passwordless ssh?</h3>

<p>There are a number of reasons why your passwordless ssh setup might
not be working but by far the most common (and the hardest to detect on
the client side!) is incorrect permissions on your <tt>.ssh</tt> directory.
Because the <tt>authorized_keys</tt> file contains sensitive information
it must not be readable by any other user. Therefore you should ensure
that the file <tt>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt> have permissions
<tt>-rw-------</tt> (i.e. 600).  660 (<tt>-rw-rw----</tt>) will not work even if you are
the only member of the group that owns the <tt>authorized_keys</tt>
file.  The same caution about permissions applies to the <tt>.ssh</tt>
directory itself.</p>
