<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Society Email Addresses</h2>

<h3 id="socmail">Can societies have email addresses @srcf.net?</h3>

<p>They certainly can. This can be useful for setting up 'Role' addresses
for the society account, passing mail sent to socname-president@srcf.net 
to the correct user, for example.</p>

<p>This has the obvious benefit of allowing one email address to
exist throughout the years, so when one president leaves, the email address 
remains the same, stopping users having to look up or find the latest crsid.</p>

<h3 id="defaults">What are the default society email addresses?</h3>

<p>If you have not specifically set up any mail processing for your
society, the following addresses will be in operation:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>[socname]-admins@srcf.net</b> - this address cannot be
 overridden. Mail sent here will be distributed to the individual SRCF
 mail accounts of all the users who are admins of the society. So,
 society admins who do not check their email on the SRCF should set up
 forwarding from their personal SRCF accounts to their main email
 account.</li>
 <li><b>[socname]-webmaster@srcf.net</b> - by default this address
 is re-routed to [socname]-admins@srcf.net (see above). This can be
 overridden in a society .forward file.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Since important messages for society admins may be
sent to one or other of the above addresses, which by default forward to
the local SRCF email addresses of the society admins, please ensure that
you either check your local SRCF inbox or arrange for your personal SRCF
email account to forward to an account you do read &mdash; see the FAQ
entry: <a href="/faq/email#forwarding">How do I read my SRCF email?</a>
for more details.</p>

<h3 id="forward">How do I control what happens to society email?</h3>

<p>There are two ways. One way is to set up one or more Mailman mailing
lists &mdash; see the FAQ entry: <a
href="/faq/other-services.html#lists">How do I get a Mailman mailing
list set up?</a> for more details.  These can have names of the form
[socname]@srcf.net or [socname]-[anything]@srcf.net, and will
take priority over the .forward method described below. Mailing lists
are appropriate if you wish to distribute mail to a large number of
people or if you wish mailing list members to have the ability to
(un)subscribe themselves.</p>

<p>The second method is to set up a <tt>.forward</tt> file in your
society's directory (/societies/[socname]/.forward). This will be used
to process all email sent to addresses of the form
[socname]@srcf.net or [socname]-[anything]@srcf.net, with
the exception of [socname]-admins@srcf.net which always has the
behaviour described in the previous answer, and any names already used
for your mailing lists. </p>

<h3 id="autoforward">I don't know the syntax of a .forward file, is there another way?</h3>

<p>We have a new script to create basic .forward files from a simple-to-edit 
list of forwarding addresses. To use this, first create the file 
'autoforward' in the society account's home directory, i.e. 
'/societies/[socname]/autoforward'. In that file, add lines in the format:</p>
<pre>
address:email,email,email
</pre>

<p>In a more specific example:</p>

<pre>
socialsecs:user1@cam.ac.uk,user2@example.org,user3@cam.ac.uk
</pre>

<p>When the script srcf-autoforward is run the .forward file which will be 
generated will ensure that mail to socname-socialsecs@srcf.net is 
forwarded to the three users listed in the comma separated list following 
the colon. Add any subsequent forwarding addresses you wish to the file for 
processing.</p>

<p>Once the file is created, or when you have edited the autoforwards file, run:
</p> 

<pre>
srcf-autoforward socname
</pre>

<p>to process the autoforward file and create a correctly formatted set of 
forwarding rules for your society account.</p>

<p>Note that there is one difference to the usual operation of .forward
files, which is that if no delivery is set up during the .forward file
processing, then the email will be bounced (unlike your personal
.forward file, where the mail would end up in your personal inbox).</p>

<h3 id="advancedforward">What if I want to edit my .forward file directly?</h3>

<p>Then you can do that directly, using the information below.</p>

<p>The syntax of .forward files is explained in detail in the <a
href="http://www.exim.org/">exim</a> documentation, specifically, <a
href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-3.30/doc/html/filter.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that if you use the &ldquo;save&rdquo; command, you must specify
absolute file paths (e.g.&ldquo;'/societies/mysoc/saved-emails&rdquo;),
and if you use the logfile command, you must not only use an absolute
file path but also must specify a mode parameter of 0660, otherwise the
logfile will not be readable or writable by you! e.g. &ldquo;logfile
/societies/mysoc/emaillog 0660&rdquo;</p>

<p>To get you started, here is an example .forward file for the
fictional society &ldquo;mysoc&rdquo;. It would be at
<tt>/societies/mysoc/.forward</tt>. Lines beginning with # are comments,
but note that the first line (&ldquo;# Exim filter&rdquo;) is special
and must be left intact for the filter file to work.</p>

<pre>
# Exim filter

#  mysoc-webmaster@srcf.net should go to abc12@cam.ac.uk

if ($local_part_suffix is "-webmaster") then
  deliver abc12@cam.ac.uk
endif

# Publicity address. mysoc-publicity@srcf.net should go
# to abc12 and def34

if ($local_part_suffix is "-publicity") then
  deliver abc12@cam.ac.uk
  deliver def34@cam.ac.uk
endif

# forward anything else sent to mysoc-[anything]@srcf.net
# or mysoc@srcf.net to the committee mailing list:

if not delivered then
  deliver soc-mysoc-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk
endif
</pre>
