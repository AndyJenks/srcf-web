<h1>SRCF Cloud Desktop Service</h1>

<p><img src="images/cloud12-150x150.jpg" align="right" style="margin-top: -20px; margin-left: 20px">Following a few problems with our older NX infrastructure, combined with the unsuitability of modern Linux distributions' use of accelerated 3D graphics for window management, the SRCF has developed a <b>brand new remote desktop service</b>.</p>

<p>The new SRCF Cloud Desktop is powered by the latest <b>secure cloud-based virtualisation technologies</b>: you'll receive sole use of your very own <b>dedicated Xen virtual machine</b> hosted on our in-house private cloud.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://defenestration.srcf.net/nebula?op=deploy_console&type=Desktop31">Connect to SRCF Cloud Desktop</a></b></p>

<p style="color: #999; font-size: 85%; margin-top: 4em">Disclaimer: this is a beta service provided on a trial basis and for now you should not store any important data in your SRCF Cloud Desktop virtual machine.  The SRCF takes no responsibility for loss of data stored in the new SRCF Cloud Desktop.  The SRCF does not take backups.  The SRCF will furthermore not be held responsible for excessive buzzword inhalation, confusion of users, confusion of users' pets or significant others, confus~1 filena~1 or symptoms of unexpected nostalgia.  Wear sunscreen.</p>
