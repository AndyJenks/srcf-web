<h2>Terms of Service</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Use of the services provided by the SRCF shall be subject to these
 Terms of Service, and to:
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
   <li>
    <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/isss/rules/isss.html">the Rules Made by the University of Cambridge Information
   Strategy and Services Syndicate: http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/isss/rules/isss.html</a></li>
   <li>
    <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/isss/rules/other/network/cudnrules.html">the Authorization for Use of the CUDN rules: http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/isss/rules/other/network/cudnrules.html</a></li>
   <li>
    <a href="http://www.ja.net/documents/publications/policy/aup.pdf">the JANET Acceptable Use Policy: http://www.ja.net/documents/publications/policy/aup.pdf</a></li>
   <li>and all the other rules listed at:
    <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/network/rules/">http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/network/rules/</a></li>
</ol>
 </li>
 <li>It is not permitted by the University for people to retain their
 user accounts on machines connected to the CUDN if they are no longer
 authorised users of the CUDN.  Therefore, your SRCF user account will
 expire around the time that your University email account does.  We
 will try to give you notice of this, but this may not always be
 possible.  Membership of the SRCF is for life, and you will still be
 able to use the SRCF for web and email forwarding.</li>
 <li>The SRCF System Administrators reserve the right to view any data
 stored on, or passing through, the machines under their control for the
 purposes of ensuring their correct operation, security, and compliance
 with these Terms of Service and relevant UK and EU legislation.</li>
 <li>Members of the SRCF should understand that we will occasionally
 need to carry out maintenance on the SRCF servers.  This may involve an
 interruption in service, for example a reboot.  We will try to give you
 notice of this and we will also try to carry out any maintenance in the
 scheduled vulnerable period (Sundays 2am to 3am), but this may not
 always be possible.  Additionally, the provision of our services relies
 on several other organisations (such as CUSU, the UCS, and JANET) and
 therefore any maintenance carried out by them may also cause an
 interruption in our service.</li>
 <li>Members of the SRCF are not permitted to compromise the security or
 privacy of another user's account or data in any way.  By default, all
 files and all directories on the SRCF are world-readable, i.e. their
 contents are viewable by other members.  Members of the SRCF are
 reminded that just because something is technically possible, it
 doesn't imply that they are authorized to do it.  Therefore, members
 must not access other people's data without their explicit
 consent.</li>
 <li>Members of the SRCF must not interfere with the availability of
 SRCF services to other members of the SRCF and/or system sanity.</li>
 <li>Users of the SRCF are responsible for maintaining the security of
 their account.  This means, for example, that users must not have any
 password that is easily-guessable, users must not share any password,
 and users must not let anybody else access their account.  Note that
 this also means that users must endeavour to update any software they
 install, particularly when an updated version fixing a security
 vulnerability is released.</li>
 <li>A group account's administrators are jointly responsible for
 maintaining the security of that group account, and have exactly the
 same responsibilities regarding that group account as they have for
 their own personal accounts.</li>
 <li>Users of the SRCF are solely responsible for maintaining any needed
 backups of data they hold on the SRCF servers; the SRCF will not be held
 responsible for any loss of data.</li>
 <li>Group websites may not be run from a user's personal web
 space.</li>
 <li>The services provided by the SRCF may not be used to send, or host
 websites advertised by, unsolicited bulk email and/or USENET spam.</li>
 <li>The SRCF will pass on to you any excessive expenses that your
 use/misuse of our services incurs.  Currently, the main example of this
 is excessive chargeable bandwidth.</li>
 <li>Any violation of any of the above may result in the SRCF System
 Administrators temporarily limiting or suspending your access to SRCF
 services and/or taking any reasonable actions that they deem necessary
 to prevent further violations, and the matter may be referred to the
 SRCF Committee and/or to the University of Cambridge Computing
 Service.</li>
 <li>In the event of a dispute regarding the facts, or regarding the
 reasonableness of any sanctions imposed, the person in question
 shall have the right to appeal to the SRCF Committee.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any problems, suggestions, or questions regarding the above terms
should be directed to the system administrators by email &ndash; <a
