<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<p>The SRCF has updated its terms of service to better reflect the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>In summary, we have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>added formal definitions for <em>members</em> and <em>users</em> of the SRCF</li>
  <li>replaced use of the term <em>society</em> with the more general <em>group</em>, in line with changes made elsewhere on our website</li>
  <li>updated links to external rules provided by UIS and JANET</li>
  <li>removed the requirement for users to be authorised users of the CUDN in their own right</li>
  <li>added the requirement that users must remain contactable in order to continue using their accounts</li>
  <li>defined how we handle data of unmaintained accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>New members registered on or after Friday 19 March 2021 will be subject to version 2 of the terms.</p>
<p>Existing members with dormant users accounts will switch to version 2 of the terms upon reactivation, or on Monday 19 April 2021, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>For existing users with active accounts, <strong>by continuing to use our services on or after Monday 19 April 2021, you agree to these changes.</strong>  You may alternatively <a href="/contact">contact the sysadmins</a> to request the termination of your membership (and user account if you have one).</p>

<div class="card-header">Version 2</div>
<div class="card-body">
<p>These terms apply to all services provided by the SRCF and your use thereof while you are a Member of the SRCF.</p>
<p>Any violation of these terms may result in us limiting your access to SRCF services and/or taking any reasonable actions that we deem necessary to prevent further violations, and the matter may be referred to the SRCF Committee and/or to University Information Services. We may pass on to you any reasonable costs incurred as a result of your violation of these terms. In the event of a dispute regarding the facts, or regarding the reasonableness of any sanctions imposed, the person accused/sanctioned shall have the right to appeal to the SRCF Committee.</p>
<h4 id="definitions">Definitions</h4>
<p>Any reference in these terms to "we" or "us" refers to the SRCF System Administrators as appointed by the SRCF Committee.</p>
<p>Any Member whose personal SRCF user account ("Personal account") is enabled at a given time is also a "User" during that time. Some SRCF services are available to Users only, more broadly to Members, or to the wider University community or to the public.</p>
<h4 id="incorporated-policies">Incorporated policies</h4>
<ol style="counter-reset: list-item">
  <li>
    <p>In addition to these terms, your use of the services provided by the SRCF is subject to:
      <ol>
        <li>the Rules made by the Information Services Committee: <a href="https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-made-by-the-information-services-committee" class="uri">https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-made-by-the-information-services-committee</a>;</li>
        <li>the Authorization for Use of the CUDN: <a href="https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-and-guidelines/network-use/cudn-rules" class="uri">https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-and-guidelines/network-use/cudn-rules</a>;</li>
        <li>the JANET Acceptable Use Policy: <a href="https://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/acceptable-use-policy" class="uri">https://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/acceptable-use-policy</a>;</li>
        <li>all other rules listed at <a href="https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies" class="uri">https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies</a> as they apply either to you or to the SRCF.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>In particular, use of the SRCF for private gain or commercial purposes (such as a for-profit business, trade or consultancy) without proper authorisation is prohibited.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="contact-requirements">Contact requirements</h4>
<ol>
  <li><p>We must be able to contact all Users. If we can't contact you (for example, if our emails to you bounce, or if you do not reply to an email within a reasonable time), your Personal account and your access to services as a User will be forfeit. <strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that we have an up-to-date email address for you and that you promptly respond to requests from the committee or sysadmins.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="group-accounts">Group accounts</h4>
<ol>
  <li><p>Group accounts must have one or more active Users registered as Group Admins. If a User's Personal account is cancelled, they will also be removed from any Groups for which they are an Admin. <strong>If a Group no longer has any registered Admins, the Group account itself will also become suspended (and later deleted; see 10). It is the responsibility of a Group's Admins to maintain an up-to-date roster of Admins.</strong></p></li>
  <li><p>Admins of a Group account share joint responsibility for the upkeep, contents and actions of that account.</p></li>
  <li><p>Personal accounts must not be used to host anything which might need to be maintained by more than one person, such as a society website; you should apply for a Group account for this purpose.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="data-retention-and-security">Data retention and security</h4>
<p><em>Please see <a href="https://www.srcf.net/privacy">our privacy statement</a> for more information about how we handle your data.</em></p>
<ol style="counter-set: item 5">
  <li><p>You grant us permission to view any information stored, processed, transmitted or received by our systems for the purposes of ensuring correct operation, integrity, security and compliance with these Terms of Service and relevant legislation.</p></li>
  <li><p>You are not permitted to compromise or allow to be compromised the security, privacy, integrity or availability of another person's or Group's account or data, or of the SRCF itself. In particular you may not access another person's data without their explicit consent.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account(s). This means, for example, that:
      <ol>
        <li>no password may be easily guessable;</li>
        <li>you must not share any password or other security credential;</li>
        <li>you must not give anybody else privileged access to your account(s), other than by making them a Group Admin;</li>
        <li>you must endeavour to update any software installed in your account(s), particularly when an updated version fixing a security vulnerability is released.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>You must take full responsibility for dealing with the consequences you suffer from data loss or disruption to SRCF services. The SRCF is not in a position to make any guarantees whatsoever. So, for example, <strong>you must maintain your own backups of any irreplaceable data you store on the SRCF</strong>. We strongly recommend that you do not use the SRCF as part of any safety-critical system.</p></li>
  <li><p>We will delete all data stored in a Personal or Group account if the account remains cancelled or suspended for an extended period of time.</p></li>
  <li><p>You may not wilfully or recklessly waste or cause to be wasted the resources or time of the SRCF, its volunteers or its providers.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="changes">Changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li><p>We may make changes to these terms in future. If we do so, we will notify all people to whom the changes apply at least 30 days before the new terms come into effect.</p></li>

    <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/network/rules/">http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/network/rules/</a></li>
</ol>
 </li>
 <li>It is not permitted by the University for people to retain their
 user accounts on machines connected to the CUDN if they are no longer
 authorised users of the CUDN.  Therefore, your SRCF user account will
 expire around the time that your University email account does.  We
 will try to give you notice of this, but this may not always be
 possible.  Membership of the SRCF is for life, and you will still be
 able to use the SRCF for web and email forwarding.</li>
 <li>The SRCF System Administrators reserve the right to view any data
 stored on, or passing through, the machines under their control for the
 purposes of ensuring their correct operation, security, and compliance
 with these Terms of Service and relevant UK and EU legislation.</li>
 <li>Members of the SRCF should understand that we will occasionally
 need to carry out maintenance on the SRCF servers.  This may involve an
 interruption in service, for example a reboot.  We will try to give you
 notice of this and we will also try to carry out any maintenance in the
 scheduled vulnerable period (Sundays 2am to 3am), but this may not
 always be possible.  Additionally, the provision of our services relies
 on several other organisations (such as CUSU, the UCS, and JANET) and
 therefore any maintenance carried out by them may also cause an
 interruption in our service.</li>
 <li>Members of the SRCF are not permitted to compromise the security or
 privacy of another user's account or data in any way.  By default, all
 files and all directories on the SRCF are world-readable, i.e. their
 contents are viewable by other members.  Members of the SRCF are
 reminded that just because something is technically possible, it
 doesn't imply that they are authorized to do it.  Therefore, members
 must not access other people's data without their explicit
 consent.</li>
 <li>Members of the SRCF must not interfere with the availability of
 SRCF services to other members of the SRCF and/or system sanity.</li>
 <li>Users of the SRCF are responsible for maintaining the security of
 their account.  This means, for example, that users must not have any
 password that is easily-guessable, users must not share any password,
 and users must not let anybody else access their account.  Note that
 this also means that users must endeavour to update any software they
 install, particularly when an updated version fixing a security
 vulnerability is released.</li>
 <li>A society account's administrators are jointly responsible for
 maintaining the security of that society account, and have exactly the
 same responsibilities regarding that society account as they have for
 their own personal accounts.</li>
 <li>Users of the SRCF are solely responsible for maintaining any needed
 backups of data they hold on the SRCF servers; the SRCF will not be held
 responsible for any loss of data.</li>
 <li>Society websites may not be run from a user's personal web
 space.</li>
 <li>The services provided by the SRCF may not be used to send, or host
 websites advertised by, unsolicited bulk email and/or USENET spam.</li>
 <li>The SRCF will pass on to you any excessive expenses that your
 use/misuse of our services incurs.  Currently, the main example of this
 is excessive chargeable bandwidth.</li>
 <li>Any violation of any of the above may result in the SRCF System
 Administrators temporarily limiting or suspending your access to SRCF
 services and/or taking any reasonable actions that they deem necessary
 to prevent further violations, and the matter may be referred to the
 SRCF Committee and/or to the University of Cambridge Computing
 Service.</li>
 <li>In the event of a dispute regarding the facts, or regarding the
 reasonableness of any sanctions imposed, the person in question
 shall have the right to appeal to the SRCF Committee.</li>
