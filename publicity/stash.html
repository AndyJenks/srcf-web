<h1>Stash</h1>
<p>Periodically we produce SRCF stash. Members of the current committee (2009-2010) are looking at placing an order in the near future. If you want to join our order, please email<a href="mailto:publicity-stash@srcf.net?subject=Stash!&amp;body=I%20***%20would%20like%20to%20get%20some%20SRCF%20stash..."> your friendly publicity officer.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately the current stash now has an invalid SSH key and so we are currently looking for a different
idea of something to go on the back of the stash.</p>
