<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Interactive access to the SRCF machine is normally done over a
  series of networks (e.g., a College network, the University's
  network, then CUSU's network, where the server resides). It is
  possible to intercept data travelling over a network and examine it
  or tamper with it. There is a small risk that someone could
  intercept data users send to the SRCF server, and if that data
  includes a user's password, then the "attacker" can gain access to
  the SRCF machine, appearing to be that user -- the typical case is
  where the "attacker" breaks into a machine connected to a network,
  and uses it to listen to the network so as to intercept passwords,
  then uses these passwords for further breakins. The SRCF wishes to
  minimise this risk for its users.
<p>
  Network interception of passwords and other potentially confidential
  data can be rendered infeasible by the use of encryption. Some
  access software which is used to connect to the SRCF will encrypt
  data sent over the network. The SRCF encourages all users to
  choose such software over non-encrypting alternatives.

<p>
  The <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/">University Computing
  Service</a> also strongly recommend SSH over Telnet for remote
  logins to systems within the University as insecure user logins can
  put the whole system at risk. If you aren't running a Windows system
  and want to get an SSH client, the computing service issue an <a
  href="http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/CD/">SSH CD</a> (for free)
  which contains SSH clients for many platforms. If you are running a
  Windows system, it's probably easiest to download the preconfigured
  set from here.

<h2>Getting the software</h2>

<h3>Windows</h3>

Windows users may use PuTTY to access the SRCF service. 

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Official version of PuTTY</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Information about how to upload your webpages without exposing your 
password to potential attackers can be found in our 
<a href="/faq/basics">FAQ</a>.</p>

<!--<p>The putty package includes the command line secure copy tool,
pscp. However, windows users may feel more comfortable using the
graphical <a href="http://winscp.vse.cz/eng/">WinSCP</a> tool.-->

<h3>Linux / UNIX</h3>  

Most Linux and UNIX systems have ssh installed on them. Ask your local
sysadmin if just typing `<tt>ssh yourusername@shell.srcf.net</tt>'
doesn't do the right thing. 

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/CD/">UCS Unix Support's SSH CD</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>MacOS</h3>

<p><a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> is a nice SFTP client for MacOS X</p>

<h3>Java</h3>

<p>
Particularly useful in cybercafes where new software is difficult or
infeasible to install, MindTerm is a small programme which a web browser
may download. It is a Java applet, and as such runs inside the browser,
with permission to connect back to the webserver over the network.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, the SRCF webserver and the SRCF interactive login service are both
currently hosted on the same machine. 
This is in the process of being resolved -- we ideally want role addresses, 
so "ssh www.srcf.net" should be wrong, and we want "ssh shell.srcf.net".
