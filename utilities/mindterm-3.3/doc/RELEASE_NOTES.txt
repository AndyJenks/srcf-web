                    Release notes for MindTerm 3.3

* Telnet mode
  There is now a telnet main class which can be used to launch
  MindTerm directly into telnet mode. This class is:
  com.mindbright.aplication.MindTermTelnet

* Password auth over keyboard-interactive
  The SSH2SimpleClient has been enhanced to also be able to use
  keyboard interactive when supplied with a password. Today many ssh
  servers use the keyboard interactive authentication protocol, even
  when just doing password authentication. This feature makes it easy
  to connect to these servers.

* Changed default Look&Feel to Nimbus
  Use the latest Java L&F if available. This looks a lot nicer.

* Fixed FTPoverSFTP module symbolic link handling
  The FTPoverSFTP module did not print symbolic links correctly. As
  part of this fix the FileAttributes.lname field was removed.

* Improvements to the sftp client code
  Updated to follow draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt, and fixed issues
  which appeared when talking to the latest version of OpenSSH.

* Alternate screen handling
  Added implementation for tty escape 47 (1047) "alternate screen"
  (Provided by Kevin Walsh)

* Font selector now lists more fonts
  Fixed the font selector to show all system fonts rather than just the
  four java built in fonts (at least if a modern java is used).

* Bug fix: Parsing ASN.1 strings
  Fixed problem with parsing indefinite length ASN.1 strings.

* Bug fix: VT100 cursor movement
  Fixed bug with vt100 cursor movement. Fix provided by Zeeshan Arif.

* Bug fix: screen update
  Fixed bug where the screen was not refreshed properly during find

* Bug fix: selection change
  Fixed bug where the selection was modified when popup was shown

* Changed font width detection code
  The font width checking code now looks through a number of
  characters while looking for the widest character, rather than just
  assuming that 'W' is the widest.

* Not all classes included in filesets.xml
  Added missing classes to filesets.xml (thanks to Serkan Kaba)

* Enhanced ASN.1 support
  Added ASN.1 classes for more PKCS#7 structures and some common Microsoft 
  structures.

* Support Kerberos auth with short server names
  Improved Kerberos auth to handle non FQDN server names

* Bug fix: properties were not always loaded
  Properties were not loaded when connecting automatically to a server
  (with quiet=true)

* More tolerance
  Handle broken ssh servers which include no string in their IGNORE
  message.

* Bug fix: terminal window could hang
  Doing 'Close' while trying to run a command in MindTerm application
  would cause it to hang until user input.

* Bug fix: vt320 and vt102 where mixed up
  Fixed bug where setting the terminal type to vt320 actually set it
  to vt102 and vice versa.

* Bug fix: alt-tab handling
  Fixed bug where alt-tab left the menu bar highlighted (patch by
  Kevin Walsh)
