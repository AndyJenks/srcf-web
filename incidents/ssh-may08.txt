-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Executive summary:  connecting to the SRCF may result in a security warning 
which you will have to act to solve; read below for the solution.  Also you 
really should CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Detail:
- -------

Secure connections to the SRCF (using SSH (PuTTY etc.), SCP or SFTP (WinSCP, 
iXplorer, FileZilla, etc.)) are protected by a "host key" held only by the 
SRCF, which ensures that your data and passwords cannot be read by anyone 
else whilst in transit between your computer and the SRCF.

The host keys on the SRCF servers were insecure due to a software fault [1] 
which may have caused them to be obtainable by an intruder. This means that 
any data sent over a SSH connection to our servers recently has an outside 
chance of being readable by anyone, including any passwords typed.

As a precaution, it is strongly recommended that you CHANGE YOUR SRCF 
PASSWORD and any passwords for other systems which you may have typed via a 
SRCF server.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

What To Do About The Scary Errors:
- ----------------------------------

As a result of this potential security breach, the host keys have been 
changed, and you will likely see a warning message to this effect when 
connecting via SSH to the SRCF server:

"WARNING - POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACH!

The server's host key does not match the one PuTTY has cached. This means 
that either the server administrator has changed the host key, or you have 
actually connected to another computer pretending to be the server.

The new rsa2 key fingerprint is: (...)

If you were expecting this change and trust the new key, press "Accept" to 
update PuTTY's cache and continue connecting. (etc.)"

(The exact appearance of the message will vary depending on the software you 
are using; the above quoted message is from PuTTY.)

If presented with such a message, you should VERIFY CAREFULLY that the 
fingerprint shown in the message matches one of the ones quoted below. 
Only then should you follow the instructions given to remove the message 
(e.g. click 'Accept' if using PuTTY).  If using Linux, you can run 
'ssh-keygen -R pip.srcf.ucam.org' or similar to remove the record of the old 
host key.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that this problem is NOT specific to the SRCF; almost any Linux 
server running Debian or Ubuntu will have to change its keys.  If you run 
your own Linux system with an affected SSH server, please refer to 
http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~mjj29/openssl.txt for more information.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any queries regarding the security of your data or our servers, 
please do not hesitate to get in touch.  Thanks for your understanding in 
this matter, and apologies for the inconvenience the key change will cause.
