<h1>SRCF Cloud Desktop Service</h1>

<p><img src="images/cloud12-150x150.jpg" align="right" style="margin-top: -20px; margin-left: 20px">Following the success of the new SRCF Cloud Desktop last year, powered by the latest <b>secure cloud-based virtualisation technologies</b>, we have acknowledged a few problems with that trial service and can now present a much more modern system.  You'll receive sole use of your very own <b>dedicated cloud server</b> hosted on our in-house private cloud&mdash;now with preemptive multitasking!</p>

<p><b><a href="https://defenestration.srcf.net/nebula?op=deploy_console&type=Desktop4">Connect to SRCF Cloud Desktop</a></b></p>

<p style="color: #999; font-size: 85%; margin-top: 4em">Disclaimer: this is a beta service provided on a trial basis and for now you should not store any important data in your SRCF Cloud Desktop virtual machine.  The SRCF takes no responsibility for loss of data stored in the new SRCF Cloud Desktop.  The SRCF does not take backups.  Even if we might hypothetically occasionally accidentally be known to buy hard drives labelled "backup", they are not associated with this service.<br><br>This service includes, for no extra charge, use of the SRCF's MOaaS and BGDaaS&mdash;mouse offset as a service, and buggy graphics drivers as a service.</p>
